Weekly Progress Summary â€“ Dissertation Work (Semi-Supervised Fraud Detection in PPP Loans)

This week focused on dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a foundational step in the clustering methodology detailed in Chapter 4. Key accomplishments and milestones include:

1. Dimensionality Reduction via PCA
Applied PCA on both the full preprocessed feature set and a key subset of features, handling missing values conservatively to maintain interpretive integrity.

Explored multiple configurations:

Variance-based PCA retaining 95% of total variance, which reduced both feature sets to a single component.

Fixed-component PCA with 2 and 3 components, enabling visual inspection of clustering potential and feature interactions.

Created visual outputs aligned with APA standards, including:

2D scatterplots by fraud label using a muted, scientific color palette.

Side-by-side bar plots for component loadings to identify key feature contributions.

2D projections from 3D PCA results (PC1 vs PC2, PC2 vs PC3, PC1 vs PC3) for both feature sets.

2. Documentation and Writing Progress
Drafted the Principal Component Analysis subsection under the Clustering Methodology section of Chapter 4, providing technical explanation, methodological rationale, and visual interpretations.

Structured the narrative to align with the CRISP-DM modeling framework and connect directly with the research questions.

3. Visualization and Presentation Improvements
Standardized all figure styles using the custom apa.mplstyle stylesheet.

Tuned visual clarity through appropriate color selection, axis scaling, and consistent formatting across plots.

4. Technical Environment Updates
Troubleshot path and kernel issues within the working Jupyter environment.

Verified proper functioning of APA-compliant figure generation workflows across both local and virtual environments.
