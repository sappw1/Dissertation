Weekly Progress Summary – Dissertation Work (Semi-Supervised Fraud Detection in PPP Loans)
This week’s work focused on preparing the core analytical foundation for Chapter 4. Key accomplishments include:

Manual Tagging of Known Fraud Cases:

Completed a full manual review and labeling of relevant PRAC and DOJ press releases.

Matched fraudulent cases to PPP loan applications to generate the labeled subset used for supervised learning and evaluation.

Loan Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Cleaned and standardized the SBA PPP loan dataset (~960K records).

Addressed missing values, standardized categorical and numeric features, and ensured compatibility with clustering and classification algorithms.

Applied hashing to PII fields (e.g., BorrowerName, Address, Lender) to maintain confidentiality while preserving uniqueness.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted detailed exploration of key features (e.g., loan amount, forgiveness ratio, jobs reported).

Created visualizations including histograms, Q-Q plots, binned bar charts, and a correlation heatmap to uncover patterns and outliers.

Developed APA-style publication-ready figures and a summary statistics table comparing fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent loans.

Drafting of Chapter 4:

Drafted the initial Data Cleaning and Preprocessing section of Chapter 4 based on implemented steps and rationale.

Finalized methodology language for imputation strategy, standardization, encoding, and feature engineering.

All preprocessing scripts and visualizations have been versioned and stored in the research repository, along with an APA-formatted table summarizing grouped statistics by fraud label.
