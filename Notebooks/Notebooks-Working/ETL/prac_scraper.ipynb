Choi fabricated the existence of hundreds of employees, manipulated bank and tax records, and falsified a driver’s license on the applications.\n",
            "Choi falsely represented to the lenders that the companies controlled by him had hundreds of employees and paid over $3 million in monthly wages. In one instance, Choi emailed a lender falsely claiming that he just told 150 of his employees that they were losing their jobs because the PPP loan had not yet come through, and that he had “watched grown men and women crying.” Choi wrote in that same email that he “sincerely hope[d]” that the lender’s employee “would never find [himself] in this kind of situation.”\n",

The PPP consists of loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. \n",
            "Tiara Walker of Miami, Florida, was arrested on September 9, 2020, on charges of Wire Fraud, Bank Fraud, and Conspiracy to Commit Wire and Bank Fraud. The complaint alleges that from May to July, 2020, Walker and her co-conspirators prepared at least 90 fraudulent PPP loan applications worth more than $24 million dollars. Forty-two of those loans were approved and funded for a total of approximately $17.4 million dollars. In Columbia, South Carolina, seven individuals were indicted yesterday for laundering over $750,000 of fraudulently obtained funds including over $390,000 from a PPP loan. The South Carolina indictment marks the 50th PPP-fraud case to date across the country. Prosecutors in the Northern District of Florida are also committed to cracking down on those who would steal money meant for those who have been among the hardest-hit during the COVID-19 crisis.\n",
            "“For the past few months, our prosecutors have been working tirelessly with our federal law enforcement partners, including the Small Business Administration-Office of Inspector General, IRS-Criminal Investigations, FBI, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General, to detect and investigate fraudulent PPP loans,” said U.S. Attorney Keefe. “Though many of these investigations are ongoing and the details of them are not yet publically known, the Northern District of Florida is devoting significant resources to prosecute offenders who divert the limited COVID-19 relief funds away from legitimate small business owners.”\n",

            "Press Release:\n",
            "Detroit resident Darrell Baker pleaded guilty today to bank fraud and money laundering arising out of a $590,000 Covid-19 fraud scheme, announced United States Attorney Matthew Schneider.\n",
            "Joining in the announcement were Special Agent in Charge Steven M. D’Antuono, Federal Bureau of Investigation and Inspector General Hannibal Mike Ware of the Small Business Administration’s Office of Inspector General.\n",
            "Darrell Baker, 56, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud arising from his effort to obtain some $590,000 by defrauding a Pennsylvania financial institution in the issuance of a Payroll Protection Program Loan. Baker also pleaded guilty to one count of money laundering, the result of financial transactions he engaged in with the fraudulently obtained funds.  \n",
            "United States Attorney Schneider stated, “My office and our law enforcement partners have no tolerance for frauds affecting programs designed to help our economy survive the Covid-19 pandemic. We will prosecute such cases aggressively, and today’s guilty plea is an example of our commitment to holding accountable anyone fraudulently obtaining pandemic relief funds to line their own pockets.”   \n",
            "“Mr. Baker's scheme exploited a fund designed specifically to support Americans during this financially challenging time,” said Steven M. D’Antuono, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in Michigan. “Thanks to the hard work of the FBI and all of the agencies involved in this investigation, monies set aside for hard working Americans who are not able to work during this pandemic is secure and available for the people that need it most, not for the fraudsters like Mr. Baker.\"\n",
            "According to the plea agreement, Baker applied for and obtained a $590,000 Payroll Protection Program Loan on behalf of a purported business that he owns, called “Motorcity Solar Energy, Inc.” The Payroll Protection Program is a program managed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) that provides loans to help businesses keep their workforces employed during the Covid-19 crisis. The SBA will forgive the loans if all employees are kept on the payroll for eight weeks and the money is used for payroll, rent, mortgage interest, or utilities. The Payroll Protection Act loans are funded from participating banks, in this case Customers Bank in Pennsylvania.\n",
            "According to the plea documents, Baker submitted paperwork with his loan application representing that Motorcity Solar Energy Inc. had 68 employees and, in 2019 paid wages, tips, and other compensation totaling $2.8 million. All of these representations were in fact false. Motor City Solar Energy had no employees, no payroll expenses of any kind, and was not an operational business. Baker submitted these false statements as part of a scheme to intentionally defraud Customers Bank and the Payroll Protection Program.   \n",
            "The plea documents state that Baker managed to withdraw approximately $172,000 of the $590,000 loan he obtained before Baker’s own financial institution froze the remainder, which was ultimately returned to Customer’s Bank. Baker used the funds he did obtain to purchase four cashier’s checks, and used the four checks to purchase two Cadillac Escalades, a Dodge Charger, and a Hummer.  The plea agreement requires Baker to forfeit these vehicles. As part of the plea agreement, Baker also agreed to the entry of a money judgment against him in the amount of $172,484.40, which represents the portion of the loan that Baker obtained before his fraud was uncovered and the balance of the loan frozen.   \n",

            "Good morning and thank you for joining us today.\n",
            "Over the course of the past six months, the COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc across our country and presented unprecedented challenges for ordinary Americans from all walks of life. \n",
            "In addition to inflicting a devastating toll in terms of human lives lost, the pandemic has caused widespread economic disruption that has harmed countless American businesses and American workers. \n",
            "Despite these challenges, the Administration has taken a number of important steps to combat the pandemic and the economic crisis it caused. \n",
            "On March 27th of this year, Congress passed and President Trump signed into law a sweeping set of relief measures in the CARES Act. \n",
            "As part of the CARES Act, the federal government made hundreds of billions of dollars in forgivable loans available to American businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. \n",
            "These PPP loans were made available to businesses so they would have funds available to keep paying their workers, in order to avoid catastrophic job losses during a time of national emergency.\n",
            "As President Trump made clear when he signed the CARES Act into law, the PPP was intended to provide a much-needed lifeline to American businesses and American workers who – through no fault of their own – were suffering terribly during this national emergency.\n",
            "By the time the PPP closed to new applications on August 8th, over 5.2 million loans had been approved, for a total in excess of $525 billion. \n",
            "These loans were made to businesses in virtually all sectors of the economy, from manufacturing and construction to health care, education, and the arts. \n",
            "These loans allowed American businesses to keep paying their employees and, in turn, allowed those employees to continue paying their rent, mortgages, and other bills, and to continue putting food on the table.\n",
            "The PPP represented critical help at a critical time.  \n",
            "Unfortunately, almost every crisis brings out not only those who seek to help others, but also those who try to exploit the situation for their own unlawful purposes and financial gain. \n",
            "Early on, Attorney General Barr recognized that the pandemic would present fraudsters and other bad actors with a unique opportunity to take advantage of the crisis, and he directed the Department of Justice to take swift action to protect law-abiding Americans. \n",
            "At Attorney General Barr’s direction, the Department of Justice has taken a number of important steps to combat pandemic-related fraud.\n",
            "One area of particular focus has been the PPP program.  Experience has taught us that any time the federal government makes a large amount of money available to the public on an expedited basis, the opportunities for fraud are clear. \n",
            "The Criminal Division – and the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section in particular – moved quickly to combat fraud in connection with the PPP program. \n",
            "We set up a team dedicated to PPP fraud, began investigating almost immediately, and brought our first cases within months of the PPP being announced, and while loans were still being made. \n",
            "We did this not only to protect the integrity of the PPP and the taxpayer funds it was disbursing, but also to send a message of deterrence to would-be fraudsters – while loans were still being made – that the Department was standing watch and would move aggressively to prosecute those who defrauded this critical program.\n",
            "We are here today to announce a key milestone in the Criminal Division’s efforts to combat pandemic-related fraud by holding accountable those who sought to abuse the PPP. \n",
            "Today the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, along with our law enforcement partners on this stage, are announcing that as a result of law enforcement operations in the past few days – and indeed just within the past few hours – the Criminal Division has now criminally charged more than 50 people who allegedly committed fraud to obtain money from the PPP. \n",
            "This impressive number is in addition to a number of other cases that have been brought by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices around the country, with the Criminal Division’s help and support. Those offices have been an important part of the Department’s efforts as well.\n",
            "Joining me on stage today to make this important announcement are a number of key partners who have been integral to this effort, including representatives from the FBI, the SBA’s Office of Inspector General, the IRS, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the Offices of Inspectors General from the FDIC and the FHFA.  You will hear from them shortly.\n",
            "Before that, let me take a moment to briefly mention some of the individuals charged in recent days that have taken us past this important milestone of 50 charged defendants.\n",
            "Yesterday, our law enforcement partners arrested defendant Tiara Walker in Miami, who is alleged to have been part of a criminal ring that attempted to steal $24 million of PPP funds.  Another member of that ring, defendant Joshua Bellamy, was arrested this morning in Miami.\n",
            "Just a few hours ago, charges were unsealed against seven other individuals alleged to have been part of a criminal ring attempting to steal and launder hundreds of thousands of dollars in PPP funds. \n",
            "Separately, law enforcement partners this morning arrested defendants Larry Jordan and Sutukh El in Buffalo, New York, who are alleged to have tried to steal $7.6 million of PPP funds.  \n",
            "Now it is of course important to remember in announcing these charges that they are merely allegations; each charged defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \n",
            "As I mentioned, these charges, in conjunction with charges previously brought by the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section since early May of this year, bring the total number of defendants charged with PPP-related fraud by the Criminal Division to 57.\n",
            "The numbers are revealing. \n",
            "The cases we have charged involve attempts to steal over $175 million from the PPP.\n",
            "And actual losses to the federal government of over $70 million. \n",
            "Through our efforts to date, we have been able to recover or freeze over $30 million, and we expect to add to that total in the future as we seize additional funds and liquidate assets purchased with PPP funds.\n",
            "Our cases are diverse in size and scope, involving fraud ranging from loan requests for just $30,000 to approximately $24 million. \n",
            "And they span the country: we have brought charges in no fewer than 19 federal judicial districts.  These are not simple or easy cases to investigate and charge. \n",
            "They are white-collar matters.  They often involve obtaining and then piecing together often-complex financial, payroll, and tax records for individuals and companies, and sifting through other evidence. \n",
            "This makes it all the more remarkable that the Department has been able to bring so many cases so quickly and is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our attorneys, agents, and partners across the U.S. government. \n",
            "I would like to take a moment to explain the two general categories into which you’ll see our PPP cases fall.\n",
            "This first category involves individuals – or small groups – who lied about having legitimate businesses, or who claimed they needed PPP money for things like paying their workers, but instead used it to buy splashy luxury items for themselves. \n",
            "As we allege in our charging documents, these defendants used lies to obtain millions of dollars in PPP funds and then spent those funds on things like luxury cars, homes, renovations, jewelry — and even adult entertainment and gambling in Las Vegas. \n",
            "The second category of cases that I’d like to focus on are the coordinated criminal rings that have engaged in systematic, organized conduct to loot the PPP. \n",
            "The involvement of these rings is unsurprising, but it is particularly troubling, and we will be focusing on these types of cases going forward.\n",
            "As an example, we recently filed charges in Cleveland and Miami against 11 individuals, including a professional athlete and his business manager. \n",
            "This group of defendants allegedly worked in concert to try to obtain a total of $24 million in PPP funds using falsified records and fraudulent application materials. \n",
            "As an example of the teamwork involved here, to unravel this case, the Fraud Section partnered with (1) the FBI; (2) the Internal Revenue Service, Office of Criminal Investigations; (3) the Small Business Administration’s Office of the Inspector General; and (4) the FDIC’s Office of the Inspector General, as well as the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices in the Northern District of Ohio and the Southern District of Florida. \n",
            "As I mentioned, these law enforcement organizations and our U.S. Attorneys have been critical partners to the Criminal Division as it leads this effort, and we expect our joint work to continue going forward.\n",
            "As you can see from our charging documents, these cases are of all different types and sizes.  \n",
            "While we’ve taken aim at a wide variety of schemes in these cases, there are a few common threads that I’d like to highlight today.\n",
            "First are the brazen, bold, and simply false representations we allege the defendants made in their applications for PPP funds. \n",
            "These alleged misrepresentations typically centered on the nature and existence of the businesses the defendants were claiming to need funds for and included misrepresentations about things like the number of employees they had, their average monthly revenue and payroll figures, and the applicants’ criminal backgrounds. \n",
            "And in many cases these defendants didn’t stop at simply making false statements, but rather tried to back up their alleged lies with fake documents, like falsified tax records, dummy payroll and revenue records, and in some cases even stolen personal information from unsuspecting third parties. \n",
            "Another common thread among these cases is the defendants’ use of their stolen PPP funds for entirely illegitimate purposes. \n",
            "We allege that many of these defendants took the relief money offered by the PPP and spent it on things having absolutely nothing to do with relief — often on luxury items for themselves, their families, and their friends such as cars, jewelry, travel, and other personal expenses. \n",
            "For example, in late July, we charged David Hines of Miami with fraudulently obtaining almost $4 million in PPP funds and using them, in part, to buy an exotic, $320,000 Lamborghini sports car.\n",
            "And in August, we charged five defendants with fraudulently obtaining millions in PPP funds and using them, in part, to buy a luxury Mercedes, a Range Rover, and $125,000 in jewelry.\n",
            "PPP funds were intended to help keep American businesses afloat.\n",
            "They were intended to help ordinary, everyday Americans pay their bills and put food on the table. \n",
            "I can assure you they were not intended to help support fraudsters’ dreams of owning Lamborghinis, Rolls Royces, Range Rovers, or diamond jewelry.\n",
            "A third key point to remember is an obvious one:\n",
            "The money these defendants stole was taxpayer money. \n",
            "Every dollar received was a dollar drawn from the American people’s account. \n",
            "Even worse, every dollar they took was a dollar set aside to help our fellow Americans weather one of the worst national crises in recent history. \n",
            "And as we allege, these defendants tried to steal it for themselves.\n",
            "And a fourth key point is that in each and every one of these cases, the success of the defendant’s fraudulent loan application meant that there were fewer funds available at that time in the PPP for legitimate businesses that were in genuine need of support. \n",
            "You don’t need to look very far in the press to see reports of the unbelievable pace at which PPP loans were snapped up. \n",
            "The program was so popular, the initial tranche of funds was quickly exhausted and Congress had to re-authorize the program, making billions more dollars available in additional loan funds.\n",
            "This program was popular because American businesses and American workers needed the money to pay their bills.   And they needed that help quickly.\n",
            "But these defendants decided that they wanted the money to line their pockets instead. \n",
            "By doing so, they prevented or delayed other businesses with legitimate needs from accessing these critical funds.\n",
            "These cases are tremendously important for many reasons, especially during this period of national emergency. \n",
            "And there are some critical aspects of our investigation and prosecution of these cases which bear highlighting.\n",
            "First is the unparalleled speed with which these cases have been investigated and prosecuted. \n",
            "The PPP hasn’t even been in existence for six months, yet we are here today announcing that more than 50 defendants have been charged. \n",
            "Our efforts began the very same day the SBA launched the PPP, with the formal creation of a team in the Fraud Section under the leadership of Fraud Section Chief Rob Zink devoted to PPP-related investigations and prosecutions. \n",
            "Our prosecutors, and the group of agencies represented on this stage, moved quickly to establish law enforcement partnerships, obtain critical data and evidence, and take concrete and affirmative steps to identify fraud committed on the PPP. \n",
            "Just one month later the Division brought the very first series of PPP-related fraud cases. \n",
            "This pace is, to our knowledge, without precedent in the history of the Department’s white-collar criminal enforcement efforts. \n",
            "Second, I’d like to highlight the Division’s use of data analytics to develop these cases so quickly.\n",
            "As I mentioned before, there were over 5.2 million PPP loans made.\n",
            "To bring these cases as quickly as we have, and to sort through the volume of loans made by the SBA, the Fraud Section and its partners deployed the first-in-class data analytics capabilities they have developed and employed to great effect in other criminal investigative areas, such as health care fraud and market manipulation. \n",
            "The Fraud Section has truly become a market leader in its use and development of these techniques, and here again we see their potential. \n",
            "Another key component of our ability to bring these cases so quickly has been our use of public-private partnerships to maximize our awareness and visibility of suspicious conduct and our collection of critical evidence. \n",
            "Many financial institutions have been strong partners in assisting us in detecting and investigating potentially fraudulent activity in connection with the PPP and other government aid programs and safeguarding taxpayer dollars by freezing funds and accounts.  \n",
            "I would like to thank them for their help and support.\n",
            "Finally, I would like to highlight the whole-of-government approach that we have employed in bringing these cases.  This is not only reflected by the agencies represented here before you today, but by our U.S. Attorney partners and others, who have enabled the nationwide scope of these efforts. \n",
            "I’ll note, in particular, our partners here on stage, who you will hear from in a minute. \n",
            "It would not have been possible to stand up this program so quickly, or to investigate and charge so many cases so fast, without their assistance.\n",
            "This has truly been a team effort, and so I want to thank all of you and your respective teams for everything you have done to achieve these results on this incredibly fast timetable for the American people.\n",
            "Now, these 50-plus cases are significant in and of themselves, but you should also know that there is more to come. \n",
            "Our work is ongoing.  We are not done yet. \n",
            "The agencies represented behind me and prosecutors here in the Criminal Division are working tirelessly to help during this time of national emergency by bringing accountability to those who would victimize the American people. \n",
            "And I should point out that these cases are not brought at a time when the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section prosecutors are sitting idle. \n",
            "As you may know, the Fraud Section has charged a record number of individual and corporate criminal cases and resolved a record number of corporate cases over the past three years. \n",
            "We’ve been incredibly busy policing the markets and holding individual and corporate wrongdoers accountable for their misconduct. \n",
            "Just this year – despite the challenges COVID-19 has posed to our investigations – the Fraud Section alone has announced criminal charges against more than 125 individual defendants. \n",
            "With respect to corporate crime, the Fraud Section this year has resolved seven corporate criminal cases and imposed over $940 million in corporate criminal monetary payments here in the U.S., with worldwide monetary penalties, restitution, and disgorgement totaling over $4.5 billion. \n",
            "And there will be much more to come between now and year’s end, both with respect to individual and corporate criminal accountability. \n",
            "So again, my thanks to everyone here today for their work.\n",
            "I would also like to thank, in particular, Attorney General Barr for his leadership on this issue.  He quickly recognized the significant potential for COVID-related fraud, and he directed us to bring the Department’s resources to bear to help the American people.  We have done so. \n",
            "Today is a significant milestone.  But we have much more to do, and we are fortunate to have such a dedicated and talented team in place.\n",
            "And let me just end by with what I hope will be an unmistakable message to those who might consider abusing programs like the PPP that provide critical lifelines for American business and American workers:\n",
            "You will be identified.  You will be held accountable.  You will face the severest of consequences for trying to exploit your fellow Americans’ suffering for your own personal gain. \n",
            "The Department of Justice, with our partners across government, will continue to use every tool available to us to ensure the integrity of the relief provided by the government to this unprecedented national emergency.  The American people deserve nothing less. \n",
            "I’d now like to hand it over to Rob Zink, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General overseeing the Fraud Section, and the leader of our work in this area, to say a few words.\n",

            "Link: https://www.justice.gov/usao-sc/pr/seven-charged-connection-over-750000-money-laundering-scheme-involving-funds-paycheck\n",
            "Press Release:\n",
            "Columbia, South Carolina --- United States Attorney Peter M. McCoy, Jr., announced today that seven individuals were charged in an indictment with laundering over $750,000 of fraudulently obtained funds, including over $390,000 from a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan. The defendants used a variety of methods to launder the money, including laundering the money through a casino. The indictment also identifies over $2.1 million in funds which agents seized from twelve different bank accounts allegedly associated with the overall fraud scheme. According to the Department of Justice (DOJ), the indictment marks the 50th PPP-fraud case to date across the country.\n",
            "The case started as an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) investigation that targeted high-level heroin and methamphetamine traffickers located in Greenville. That initial investigation has also resulted in the indictment and arrest of eight other individuals on various drug trafficking and fraud-related charges.\n",
            "“Criminals seek to take advantage of dire situations, and it is our job to stand in their way,” said U.S. Attorney McCoy. “I want to commend the federal agencies involved for their excellent work. In these unprecedented times, the Paycheck Protection Program has been a lifeline for businesses across the United States, and by extension the millions of Americans whose very livelihoods depend on these businesses. This office, in concert with our partners in law enforcement, will remain vigilant in its mission to protect our citizens, and we will prosecute those who seek to manipulate this essential program.”\n",
            "\"Taxpayer funds from the Paycheck Protection Program were supposed to keep businesses open and provide money for workers during these difficult times,\" said Jody Norris, Special Agent in Charge of the Columbia Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  \"These subjects allegedly schemed and stole money meant for our fellow citizens in need.  The FBI will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to seek out and arrest others who commit these despicable COVID related crimes.\"\n",
            "“Hitting drug traffickers in their pockets is a crucial part of dismantling high-level drug distribution networks,” said Robert J. Murphy, Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Atlanta Field Division. “Their money is their life-line and without it, their drug distribution activities could not survive. DEA and its law enforcement partners remain committed to making our communities safe.”\n",
            "“During this unprecedented time in our nation, criminals are seeking opportunities to profit from programs meant to provide financial assistance to many Americans who have been impacted by this pandemic,” said Tommy D. Coke, Inspector in Charge of the Atlanta Division of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. “Postal Inspectors will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners to aggressively identify and pursue those individuals that siphon funds illegally for their own personal gain.  We are actively investigating to combat this fraud and hope this serves as an example to anyone plotting a similar scam.”\n",
            "The indictment charges the following individuals with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering:\n",
            "\n",
            "Lauren Marcel Duhart, 34, of Stonecrest, Georgia;\n",

            "Henry Duffield, 58, of Belton, South Carolina;\n",
            "Jeremy Brandon Latourneau, 43, of Spartanburg, South Carolina; and\n",
            "Derick Keane, 43, of Spartanburg, South Carolina.\n",
            "\n",
            "During the course of the initial OCDETF investigation, agents learned that some of the drug trafficking targets were also engaged in wire fraud and money laundering. According to the indictment unsealed today, Agard utilized his business, Wild Stylz Entertainment, LLC, to launder the proceeds of fraud schemes.  As part of the scheme, Duffield, who was recruited by Lewis, allowed Agard to transfer $378,000 of fraud proceeds unrelated to PPP loans from the Wild Stylz business account to be deposited into Duffield’s business account. In return, Duffield received a portion of the proceeds. After the proceeds were deposited, Roosevelt Hunt (who has pleaded guilty to related charges), Latourneau, and Keane withdrew the funds from Duffield’s account by converting $200,000 in business checks to chips at a casino. After gambling for less than two hours, Hunt, Keane, and Latourneau cashed out from the casino and left with approximately $198,750 in cash.\n",
            "According to the documents filed with the court, in May 2020, Agard submitted a fraudulent Wild Stylz PPP loan application, along with fraudulent supporting documents that made numerous false and misleading statements about Wild Stylz’s number of employees and payroll expenses. Agard received a loan of more than $395,000 and disseminated the fraudulently obtained funds to other members of the conspiracy through various means. During multiple recorded calls in early June 2020, Duhart, Lewis, Smith, and Hunt discussed the bank and wire fraud conspiracies. In one call, Lewis informed Hunt that the scheme involved fraudulent bank applications and that they needed to submit as many applications to the bank as possible by June 30th.\n",
            "The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act is the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.\n",
            "The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent.  Businesses must use PPP loan proceeds for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.\n",
            "This case was investigated by the FBI, DEA, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and Small Business Association Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sloan P. Ellis and Brandi B. Hinton of the District of South Carolina, along with Trial Attorney Siji Moore of the DOJ Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, are prosecuting the case.\n",
            "The charges in these cases are only accusations of a crime, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n",

            "“The CARES Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by the president to provide much needed relief to Americans suffering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said U.S. Attorney Nealy Cox. “But it is an unfortunate reality that scammers, fraudsters, and criminal actors are working overtime to illegally exploit this pandemic for profit. The Department of Justice is committed to investigating and prosecuting these wrongdoers. We are eager to continue this fight against fraud by partnering with Special Inspector General Brian D.

The purpose and mission of the MOU is to develop a cooperative effort to investigate and prosecute wrongdoing involving the making, purchase, management, and sale of loans, loan guarantees, and other investments by the Secretary of the Treasury under Division A of the CARES Act, and the management by the Secretary of any program established under Division A of the CARES Act. This partnership will make efficient use of resources and help ensure coordination with regulators and law enforcement so that just results can be achieved, while at the same time taking care not to stymie legitimate businesses acting in good faith to access the important financial resources that Congress made available to the public.\n",
            "“I look forward to working with U.S. Attorney Nealy Cox and her team in the Northern District of Texas to identify fraud, waste and abuse of the money provided under the CARES Act,” said Special Inspector General Brian D.

            "PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney William M. McSwain announced that Jennifer D’Hulster, 37, of Coatesville, PA; Zachary Gathercole, 30, of Sadsburyville, PA; Ashley Harrington, 30, of West Chester, PA; and Anthony Schweitzer, 20, also of Coatesville, PA, were charged by Complaint with fraudulently obtaining and attempting to obtain unemployment benefits related to COVID-19 emergency relief funds to which they were not entitled. Defendant D’Hulster was arrested and taken into custody this morning; the other three defendants were already in custody. All four defendants made their initial appearances in federal court today.\n",
            "On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was signed into law. The CARES Act created the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance  (PUA) program, which provides unemployment benefits to individuals not eligible for regular unemployment compensation or extended unemployment benefits, including individuals, families, and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligibility to receive weekly PUA benefits was predicated on the applicant’s unemployment for reasons related to the pandemic; however, the applicant must also have been able to work each day and, if offered a job, the applicant must have been able to accept it. Once the applicant was approved to receive benefits, the applicant was required to submit weekly certifications that indicated that he or she: was ready, willing and able to work each day; was seeking full time employment; did not refuse any job offers or referrals; and, had reported any employment during the week and the gross pay or other payments received.\n",
            "The Complaint alleges that D’Hulster and Harrington assisted individuals incarcerated at Chester County Prison and other correctional institutions in fraudulent efforts to obtain Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) benefits. Harrington enabled Gathercole, who was incarcerated at Chester County Prison prior to the onset of the pandemic, to receive approximately $12,865. D’Hulster and Gathercole enabled another unidentified inmate to receive approximately $11,410 and attempted to obtain PUA benefits for another inmate. Schweitzer did not actually receive any PUA benefits, but attempted to several times. The inmates were not eligible to receive PUA benefits because they did not meet the eligibility requirements -- namely, they were not able to report to a job each day because of their incarceration.\n",
            "“Sadly, fraudsters consider a national public health crisis as an opportunity to cash in,” said U.S. Attorney McSwain. “That callous attitude rips off honest taxpayers who fund relief programs and also makes it much more difficult to provide funds to those who deserve and need them.

            "A North Carolina man pleaded guilty today to perpetrating three schemes between March and July 2020 connected to the COVID-19 pandemic, through which he defrauded consumers and the federal government’s relief programs. \n",
            "Brandon Lewis, 34, of Greensboro, North Carolina, pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging two counts of wire fraud and one count of making false statements to the Small Business Administration (SBA) before U.S. District Judge Catherine C. Eagles of the Middle District of North Carolina.  Sentencing has been scheduled for Nov. 30, 2020 before Judge Eagles. \n",
            "“Brandon Lewis today admitted to a wide range of brazen schemes specifically designed to profit illegally from the COVID-19 pandemic by defrauding scores of frightened consumers and small business owners desperate for a financial lifeline,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.  “The department and our law enforcement partners will continue to aggressively pursue and hold accountable those who seek to illegally exploit the ongoing national emergency for their own personal benefit at the expense of hardworking Americans and businesses.”\n",
            "“In the midst of a pandemic and as the economy suffered, this defendant lined his pockets by cheating online customers, small businesses, and, ultimately, all taxpayers.  Stealing from people seeking basic health and cleaning supplies while under stay at home orders, and from entrepreneurs struggling to keep their businesses afloat, may be the nadir of fraudulent conduct,” said U.S. Attorney Matthew G.T. Martin of the Middle District of North Carolina.  “I commend the excellent coordinated efforts of IRS Criminal Investigation, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Small Business Administration Inspector General, and the Treasury Inspector General.  We will aggressively investigate and prosecute anyone who tries to profit by preying on people during this pandemic.”\n",
            "“This is another example of greed controlling one’s actions.  In a time of crisis and vulnerability in our country, Mr. Lewis promised assistance and help, but delivered more heartache and anxiety,” said Special Agent in Charge Matthew D. Line of the IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI).  “I am proud of the way IRS-Criminal Investigation and our law enforcement partners quickly responded to these selfish criminal acts.  We are committed to rooting out those seeking to defraud the hard-working citizens of this country during this pandemic.”\n",
            "“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service will remain vigilant in bringing to justice anyone that seeks to defraud individuals during this pandemic,” said Inspector in Charge Tommy D. Coke of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Atlanta Division.  “These schemes highlights the importance of collaboration with our law enforcement partners to investigate and stop those seeking to take advantage of innocent victims.”\n",
            "“It is unacceptable to defraud small businesses that are struggling during these unprecedented times,” said Special Agent in Charge Kevin Kupperbusch of the SBA's Office of Inspector General (OIG)’s Eastern Region.  “Our office will relentlessly pursue fraudsters that use SBA’s programs for greed and personal gain.  I want to thank the Justice Department and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”\n",
            "“In the midst of this pandemic, anyone who attempts to engage in illegal activity will be aggressively pursued,” said J.

            "As part of his guilty plea, Lewis admitted that he created the so-called “COVID-19 Relief Fund,” which he purportedly managed and oversaw as president and founder of Lewis Revenue Group LLC.  Lewis promised desperate small business owners “guaranteed funds” of between $12,500 and $15,000 in exchange for an upfront “reservation” fee of between $995 and $1,200.  Lewis falsely claimed that “the fund has up to $250 million available for small businesses” and provided a link for applicants to “purchase a reservation now.”\n",
            "Lewis also created the so-called “American Relief Fund,” offering $5,000 grants to “every American affected by COVID-19.”  Lewis promoted these “relief funds” through sophisticated marketing and social media campaigns, even using the official trademarks and logos of purported corporate sponsors without their permission.  In reality, Lewis never had or distributed any funds through the “COVID-19 Relief Fund” or “American Relief Fund.”  Between April and May 2020, Lewis defrauded small business owners of more than $100,000 through this scheme.\n",
            "Lewis also admitted that, in mid-March 2020 as COVID-19-related stay-at-home orders across the United States began, he set up a website called “www.homekitchengoods.com,” for the online store, “Home Kitchen Goods,” where he claimed to sell pandemic-critical goods such as hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, paper towels, and toilet paper.  In fact, however, during the five days between March 20 and March 24, 2020, Lewis received over 8,500 orders totaling more than $400,000, but never had or delivered any of the promised goods. \n",
            "Lewis further admitted that, between April 1 and June 19, 2020, he lied to the SBA by fraudulently applying for and obtaining multiple loans and advances under the SBA’s EIDL program.  Specifically, Lewis purchased more than 35 “aged, off-the-shelf” corporations, and then submitted approximately 68 fraudulent loan applications and non-refundable grant “advances” of up to $10,000 through the SBA-EIDL program. \n",
            "This case was investigated by the USPIS, IRS-CI, SBA-OIG, and TIGTA.  Trial Attorney David A. Stier of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Meredith C. Ruggles are prosecuting the case. \n",

Youchah in Las Vegas.\n",
            "The complaint alleges that Casutt perpetrated a scheme to submit fraudulent EIDL applications to the SBA and PPP loan applications to federally insured banks.  The SBA guarantees the loans for COVID-19 relief through the PPP under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.  The CARES Act also authorizes the SBA to provide an EIDL of up to $2 million to eligible small businesses experiencing financial disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

Foundation, which is supposedly devoted to raising awareness about cystic fibrosis.  The loan applications indicated that each entity had numerous employees, significant payroll expenses, and substantial revenue.  According to the complaint, neither entity has employees nor pays any wages.  And Skyler’s C.F. Foundation had nowhere near the $600,000 revenue in 2019 that Casutt listed on the entity’s EIDL application.\n",

Bonanno, who is handling the case, stated that on March 19, 2020, at approximately 6:50 p.m., the defendant drove her vehicle into the parking lot of the Cheektowaga Branch Post Office by traveling the wrong way through an exit driveway. A USPS Letter Carrier (Letter Carrier) collecting mail from the mailboxes in the parking lot advised Daniels-Johnson that she had entered the parking lot through the exit driveway. In response, the defendant shouted profanities at the Letter Carrier and threatened to cough on him to give him the Coronavirus. The manager of the Cheektowaga Branch Post Office came out to the parking lot and attempted to calm Daniels-Johnson down. The defendant subsequently drove her vehicle out of the parking lot, passing by the Letter Carrier, who had resumed collecting mail from the mailboxes. As she passed the Letter Carrier, Daniels-Johnson stopped her vehicle and told the Letter Carrier her husband was going to beat him up, and then spit on the Letter Carrier, hitting the Letter Carrier in the leg.\n",

            "David Christopher Redfern, 31, of Trinity, North Carolina, was charged by criminal complaint filed in the Middle District of North Carolina with one count of wire fraud and one count of bank fraud.  Redfern was arrested this morning and made his initial appearance this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld of the Middle District of North Carolina. \n",
            "The complaint alleges that Redfern, through a company called Wilder Effects LLC (Wilder Effects) that he formed in January 2020, fraudulently applied for two EIDLs and a PPP loan between April and June of this year.  The PPP loan application was supported by falsified documents.  The false documentation included a fake IRS filing that purported to be Wilder Effects’ Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return for the first quarter of 2020, showing that the company paid wages to 20 employees, when in reality the IRS has no record of such a filing.  The complaint further alleges that EIDL and PPP loan proceeds were withdrawn in cash or transferred to Redfern’s personal bank account.  As a result of suspected fraud alerts, Wilder Effects’ bank account was frozen and approximately $402,000 of the over $414,000 in EIDL and PPP loan proceeds were recovered. \n",

            "The PPP allows qualifying small-businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses. \n",

            "“During a time of national crisis, the federal government set aside money to help struggling businesses pay their hardworking employees and keep their doors open,” said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. “Tarik Jaafar planned and executed a scheme to steal money from this essential program and use it for his own personal benefit. This office will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to make sure that federal economic assistance provides relief for beleaguered businesses and not profits for devious criminals.”\n",
            "According to court documents, Tarik Jaafar, 42, conspired with his wife, Monika Magdalena Jaworska, to create four shell companies. These companies conducted no legitimate business and existed solely as a means to execute the scheme to defraud. From April 13 to May 6, Jaafar and Jaworska applied for 18 separate PPP loans in the names of the four shell companies valued at approximately $6.6 million, falsely claiming, among other things, that the businesses had employees and they needed the loans to pay their employees’ salaries. Jaafar and Jaworska fraudulently induced banks to distribute approximately $1.4 million in loans which they intended to use for their personal benefit.\n",
            "“The Paycheck Protection Program was developed to aide small businesses during these challenging times,” said Hannibal “Mike” Ware, Inspector General of the Small Business Administration. “Our office will remain relentless in the pursuit of bad actors who seek to exploit SBA’s vital economic programs. I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and commitment to seeing justice served.”\n",

The FBI is committed to tackling COVID-related fraud head on with our local and federal partners.”\n",

            "PITTSBURGH – United States Attorney Scott W. Brady and Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro today announced that 33 individuals, including inmates at eight state and county jails and prisons in western Pennsylvania and their accomplices, have been charged in federal and state criminal complaints for illegally obtaining Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act unemployment benefits that contained false or fraudulent statements, and to which they were not entitled.\n",
            "U.S. Attorney Brady stated, \"The unprecedented scope and audacity of this inmate unemployment compensation fraud is appalling. These benefits were intended to help Pennsylvania workers make it through a difficult time. These inmates and their accomplices took advantage of this national emergency to line their pockets through fraud. Their conduct is despicable at any time, but particularly in a time of a national emergency. As these charges make clear, this conduct will not go unpunished, and my office will continue to work with our federal, state and local law enforcement partners to bring these criminals and their co-conspirators to justice. The message to those who engaged in this fraud is clear: if you submitted a fraudulent application for unemployment benefits, withdraw it. If you got a check or debit card through fraud, return it. If you don’t, expect to hear a knock on your door very soon.\"\n",
            "\"These defendants took advantage of a public health emergency to cash in on the backs of working people across our Commonwealth. They rip-offed off a program meant for everyday people whose lives were uprooted by COVID-19, some doing so from jail cells in local Pennsylvania prisons,\" said PA Attorney General Shapiro. \"Our work here is not done. We will continue to root out scammers taking advantage of a system put in place to help during a trying time.\"\n",
            "\"An important mission of the Office of Inspector General is to investigate allegations of fraud that threaten the integrity of the Unemployment Insurance program. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate this alleged criminal activity,\" said Derek Pickle, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge, Philadelphia Region, U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General.\n",
            "\"Defrauding U.S. government programs intended to provide economic relief to disaster victims is not simply a matter of theft of U.S. tax dollars. It is far more: it undermines the security and wellbeing of our most vulnerable communities at a time when they are in the greatest in need of assistance,\" said Timothy Burke, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Secret Service’s Pittsburgh Field Office. \"The U.S. Secret Service is committed to working with all of our partners, both in government and in the financial sector, to detect and arrest all those that engage in such crimes.\"\n",
            "\"The people accused today cooked up this scheme from behind bars to steal unemployment benefits that should’ve gone to families in our area who are out of work and trying to feed their families,\" said FBI Pittsburgh Special Agent in Charge Michael Christman. \"At a time when people across the country are already struggling, this group capitalized on the hardships created by the pandemic. We know there are more out there and we will not stop our investigation until those who thought they could get some free money are brought to justice.\"\n",

In Pennsylvania, the PUA program is administered by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry (DLI), but its benefits are funded in large part by the federal government.

The applicant is required to enter personally identifiable information as well as answer the eligibility questions. Individuals who are serving a sentence of incarceration, or who are detained pending a criminal trial, are neither available for work nor unemployed for reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, they are not eligible to receive PUA benefits for the period of their incarceration.\n",

The benefits were then directed to the applicants’ on-file addresses outside of the correctional facility.

            "An employee of the State of Michigan’s Unemployment Insurance Agency and a Detroit Woman were charged in a criminal complaint for their alleged role in a $1.8 million unemployment insurance fraud scheme aimed at defrauding the State of Michigan and the U.S. Government of funds earmarked for unemployment assistance during the COVID19 pandemic, announced United States Attorney Matthew Schneider.\n",
            "Joining in the announcement were Irene Lindow, Special Agent-in-Charge, Chicago Region, U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, Special Agent in Charge Douglas J. Zloto, US Secret Service and Jeffrey Frost, Special Fraud Advisor, Unemployment Insurance Agency, Michigan Dept. of Labor and Economic Opportunity.\n",
            "Charged are Jermaine Rose, 41, and Serenity Poynter 36.\n",
            "According to the complaint, Jermaine Rose was a Lead Claims Examiner for the State of Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency.  His duties included reviewing, processing and verifying the legitimacy of unemployment insurance claims.\n",
            "Beginning in May, 2020, it is alleged that Rose used his insider access to release payment on hundreds of fraudulent claims. Specifically, Rose is alleged to have used his network credentials to override “fraud stops” on unemployment insurance claims that the State computer system had identified as potentially fraudulent. Rose’s actions resulted in the fraudulent disbursement of over $1.1 million of federal and state funds intended for unemployment assistance during the pandemic. Rose attempted to override another $761,000 in fraudulent unemployment claims, but the State was able to prevent payment on those additional claims.\n",
            "Rose is alleged to have worked with outside co-conspirators as part of his fraud scheme. One of those alleged co-conspirators is Detroit resident Serenity Poynter.  Poynter, an associate of Rose’s, is alleged to have filed at least 25 fraudulent claims seeking over $350,000 in unearned unemployment insurance benefits. Poynter allegedly used variations of her own name and bogus social security numbers to support these fraudulent claims. The State’s automated system identified many of those claims as potentially fraudulent, but Rose is alleged to have overridden many of those fraud-stops, leading to approval of numerous fake unemployment insurance claims.\n",
            "“At a time when thousands of people in Michigan are out of work because of the pandemic, the defendants are charged with stealing unemployment benefits that should have gone to Michiganders trying to feed their families.  Anyone who steals unemployment funds steals from the people of Michigan,” stated United States Attorney Matthew Schneider.\n",
            "\n",
            "“An important mission of the Office of Inspector General is to investigate allegations relating to unemployment insurance fraud. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate these types of allegations,” stated Irene Lindow, Special Agent-in-Charge, Chicago Region, U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General.”\n",
            "“The defendants in this case took advantage of the good will and generosity of the American people. Out of greed and blatant disregard for those suffering during this pandemic, the perpetrators manipulated the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency system for personal gain. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners throughout Michigan to bring these criminals to justice,” said Douglas J. Zloto, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Secret Service, Detroit Field Office.\n",
            "“It’s disheartening that a public servant would abuse the trust of Michiganders because of their own greed, especially during a time when workers need this financial assistance the most. We thank the US Attorney’s office and our other state and federal law enforcement partners for their efforts to protect workers and the integrity of the unemployment system,” stated Jeffrey Frost, Special Fraud Advisor, Unemployment Insurance Agency, Michigan Dept. of Labor and Economic Opportunity.\n",
            "This is the third unemployment insurance fraud scheme charged by the United States Attorney’s Office in just over a month. On July 17, 2020, State of Michigan contract employee Bandi Hawkins was charged with participating in scheme to defraud the State of Michigan out of approximately $2 million in unemployment insurance funds. Last week, Southfield resident Samuel George Baker was similarly charged with offenses arising out of an unemployment insurance scheme allegedly targeting the States of Michigan and Pennsylvania. Those cases remain pending.\n",
            "A complaint is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt.  Trial cannot be held on felony charges in a complaint.  When the investigation is completed a determination will be made whether to seek a felony indictment.\n",
            "The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney John K. Neal. The investigation is being conducted jointly by the Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General, the United States Secret Service, and the Unemployment Insurance Agency, Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity\n",

            "David Christopher Redfern, 31, of Trinity, North Carolina, was charged by criminal complaint filed in the Middle District of North Carolina with one count of wire fraud and one count of bank fraud.  Redfern was arrested this morning and made his initial appearance this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld of the Middle District of North Carolina. \n",
            "The complaint alleges that Redfern, through a company called Wilder Effects LLC (Wilder Effects) that he formed in January 2020, fraudulently applied for two EIDLs and a PPP loan between April and June of this year.  The PPP loan application was supported by falsified documents.  The false documentation included a fake IRS filing that purported to be Wilder Effects’ Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return for the first quarter of 2020, showing that the company paid wages to 20 employees, when in reality the IRS has no record of such a filing.  The complaint further alleges that EIDL and PPP loan proceeds were withdrawn in cash or transferred to Redfern’s personal bank account.  As a result of suspected fraud alerts, Wilder Effects’ bank account was frozen and approximately $402,000 of the over $414,000 in EIDL and PPP loan proceeds were recovered. \n",

            "The PPP allows qualifying small-businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses. \n",

Thorson of the District of Minnesota and remains in custody.  He will appear for a detention hearing on Aug. 26.\n",
            "The indictment alleges Brenizer was the owner and manager of True-Cut Construction LLC (True-Cut), a contracting and construction company located in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota.  In August 2018, True-Cut and Brenizer were ordered by the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry to cease and desist from doing business and in December 2019, True-Cut’s contractor license expired and was never renewed.\n",
            "Brenizer allegedly submitted a false and misleading PPP application in the name of True-Cut seeking approximately $841,000, but the application was denied.  On May 12, 2020, Brenizer again submitted a false and misleading PPP application in the name of True-Cut seeking approximately $841,000 in PPP funds.  This time, in order to conceal his involvement, Brenizer allegedly submitted the application under the name of another individual. \n",
            "Brenizer falsely stated that True-Cut’s average monthly payroll was over $330,000 for approximately 30 employees.  In addition, Brenizer falsely certified that he was not subject to any pending criminal charges even though he was allegedly named in multiple felony charges pending in the State of Minnesota for such charges as check forgery, identify theft, and theft by swindle.  Due to these various misrepresentations and omissions, on May 13, 2020, Brenizer’s second application was approved, and he received $841,000 in PPP funds.\n",
            "According to the allegations in the indictment, instead of using the PPP funds for permissible business expenses, Brenizer transferred approximately $650,000 to a bank account unrelated to True-Cut and made a $29,000 payment to purchase a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, spent over $1,000 on golf expenses, among other retail and entertainment expenditures for his personal benefit.\n",

The cards were then loaded with additional UI payments every two weeks, throughout the duration of the scheme. According the complaint, Baker began making near-daily withdrawals in July 2020, using multiple cards each day.

Sweeney Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), Kevin Kupperbusch, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Eastern Region Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”), and Jonathan D. Larsen, Special Agent in Charge of the New York Field Office of the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (“IRS-CI”), announced today the arrest of SHENG-WEN CHENG, a/k/a “Justin Cheng,” a/k/a “Justin Jung,” a Taiwanese national residing in New York, New York, for a fraudulent scheme to obtain over $7 million in government-guaranteed loans designed to provide relief to small businesses during the novel coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic.  In connection with loan applications for relief available from the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL”) Program, CHENG used the identities of other individuals to falsely represent to the SBA and five financial institutions that companies controlled by him had a total of over 200 employees and paid $1.5 million in monthly wages, when, in fact, his companies appear to have a total of no more than 14 employees.  Of the approximately $2.8 million in PPP loan proceeds that CHENG has received to date, CHENG transferred over $880,000 abroad, withdrew approximately $360,000 in cash and/or cashier’s checks, and spent over $275,000 on personal expenses.  CHENG was charged with several counts of fraud, including major fraud against the United States, wire fraud, and bank fraud, as well as one count of aggravated identity theft for forging the electronic signature of a payroll company employee in payroll documents provided to financial institutions.  CHENG was arrested this morning and will be presented later today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stewart D. Aaron.\n",
            "Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said:  “At a time when so many small businesses and their employees are facing dire financial straits, Sheng-Wen Cheng allegedly saw not an emergency lifeline but a gravy train.  As alleged, Cheng fraudulently applied for over $7 million in government-guaranteed loans under programs designed to provide relief for small businesses financially strapped by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Cheng allegedly lied to the Small Business Administration and several financial institutions about ownership of his companies, the number of people the companies employed, and how any loan proceeds would be applied, and he used forged and fraudulent documents in the process.  Of the nearly $3 million he actually received, Cheng allegedly transferred nearly $1 million to overseas accounts, and spent nearly $300,000 on personal luxury items such as an 18-carat gold Rolex, a $17,000-a-month luxury condo, and a Mercedes.  The paid vacation ended with his arrest this morning.”\n",
            "FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr said:  “While small business owners throughout the country sought loans from the Paycheck Protection Program in order to pay employee wages and maintain basic business functions, Justin Cheng, a self-proclaimed ‘serial entrepreneur,’ acquired more than $3 million in financial relief, which he then used for personal benefit, as alleged today. True entrepreneurs who have been trying to keep their businesses afloat during these trying times are directly affected by this type of fraud, while the taxpaying citizens of this country are indirectly impacted by all those who siphon money illegitimately from this multibillion-dollar program. This isn’t the first case of SBA fraud we’ve seen, and it won’t be the last, but rest assured those who try to buck the system will be met with federal criminal charges wherever and whenever possible.”\n",
            "SBA Special Agent-in-Charge Kevin Kupperbusch, said:  “This is a critical time for our nation’s small businesses.  Our Office will continue to combat fraud schemes that involve SBA’s programs for personal gain and greed.  I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.” \n",
            "IRS-CI Special Agent in Charge Jonathan D. Larsen said:  “As alleged in the criminal complaint, Mr. Cheng fraudulently took advantage of programs meant to help those in need during a world-wide pandemic. IRS-CI will continue to prioritize investigations where criminals seek to steal money from well-deserving citizens amidst this ongoing public health crisis.”    \n",

            "CHENG, a Taiwanese national who entered the United States on a student visa, is a self-proclaimed “serial entrepreneur” who earned a Bachelor’s Degree from Pennsylvania State University (“Penn State”).  From at least in or about April 2020 through at least on or about August 13, 2020, CHENG appears to have used the identities of other individuals to submit online applications to the SBA and at least five financial institutions for a total of over $7 million in government-guaranteed loans through the SBA’s PPP and EIDL Program for several companies controlled by CHENG, namely Alchemy Finance, Inc., Alchemy Guarantor LLC d/b/a “Celer Offer,” Celeri Network, Inc., Celeri Treasury LLC, and Wynston York LLC (collectively, the “Cheng Companies”).  In connection with these loan applications, CHENG represented, among other things, that other individuals were the sole owners of the Cheng Companies and that the Cheng Companies together had over 200 employees and paid a total of approximately $1.5 million in wages to those employees on a monthly basis.  In fact, however, the Cheng Companies appear to have a total of no more than 14 employees. \n",
            "In order to support the false representations in the loan applications about the number of employees at and the wages paid by the Cheng Companies, CHENG submitted fraudulent and doctored tax records that were never actually filed with the IRS, and payroll records containing the forged electronic signature of a payroll company employee.  CHENG also submitted a payroll summary for one of his companies that listed the names of more than 90 purported employees, several of whom are current and former athletes, artists, actors, and public figures.  For example, the list of purported employee names included a co-anchor on Good Morning America, a former National Football League player, and a prominent Penn State football coach who is now deceased.\n",
            "Based on the fraudulent PPP loan applications submitted by CHENG, a total of more than $3.7 million in PPP loans were approved for the Cheng Companies and approximately $2.8 million in PPP loan proceeds were deposited into bank accounts solely controlled by CHENG as of on or about August 13, 2020.  Based on bank records received to date, instead of using the PPP loan proceeds for payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent, and/or utilities for the purported Cheng Companies as required by the PPP, CHENG used a portion of the $2.8 million in loan proceeds he received as follows: \n",

            "Press Release:\n",
            "NEWARK, N.J. – Two Ocean County, New Jersey, import companies have agreed to resolve violations of the Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950 for price-gouging customers of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic by agreeing to sell at cost approximately 11 million items of PPE seized from three warehouses by law enforcement in April 2020, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito announced today.\n",
            "The two companies – CSG Imports LLC and KG Imports LLC, both of Lakewood, New Jersey – have also agreed to disgorge $400,000 in profits relating to transactions with two customers who purchased PPE from CSG Imports at excessive prices and to compensate those customers for their losses.\n",
            "“The defendants in this case sought to profit illegally from a pandemic just as it was starting to sweep across the country,” U.S. Attorney Carpenito said. “Today’s agreements will ensure that needed personal protective equipment gets into the hands of the people who need it, and at a fair price. We will continue to investigate these price-gouging cases with our law enforcement partners and make sure that vendors stop trying to make excess profits during this national emergency.”\n",
            "“Profiteers who choose to shamelessly defraud the America public should know the FBI will utilize every means under the law to bring them to justice,” FBI Newark Acting Special Agent in Charge Joe Denahan said.\n",
            "Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, CSG Imports had never imported PPE or health-care equipment or products of any kind. KG Imports was formed after the pandemic began specifically to import PPE into the United States.\n",
            "The resolutions arise out of law enforcement’s April 22, 2020, seizure of over 11 million items of PPE – predominantly N-95 respirator face masks and three-ply disposable face masks – owned by CSG Imports and KG Imports from three warehouses in Lakewood. Law enforcement seized the PPE after learning that the companies were violating the DPA by offering for sale and selling scarce PPE at prices in excess of prevailing market prices for those items.\n",
            "Both CSG Imports and KG Imports entered into deferred prosecution agreements with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey in connection with criminal complaints filed today charging each company with one count of violating the DPA. CSG Imports has committed to selling the seized PPE at cost and compensating two entities that it sold PPE to in excess of prevailing market prices in the amount of $400,000. The agreement provides that CSG Imports must pay a minimum of $200,000 to these entities directly in amounts proportionate to CSG Imports’ profits on PPE sold to those entities and that CSG Imports may compensate the remaining portion of the $400,000 by transferring PPE to these entities at no cost. Pursuant to a separate deferred prosecution agreement, KG Imports has also agreed to sell the seized PPE at cost. \n",
            "According to the admissions:\n",
            "CSG Imports\n",
            "            Beginning in March 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Jersey and the rest of the United States and world, CSG Imports began to obtain directly from international manufacturers and import various items of PPE into the United States. When it did not deliver directly to customers, CSG Imports stored the PPE at warehouses in Lakewood and sold the PPE to customers, including hospitals, health care providers, health care suppliers, and end users in New Jersey and elsewhere.\n",
            "            From March 2020 through May 2020, CSG Imports imported into the United States and offered for sale PPE and other health and medical resources that were Designated Scarce Materials in excess of prevailing market prices. For example, CSG Imports imported N-95 masks for a blended per-unit cost of $3.47 and sold them with markups ranging from $0.78 to $2.53. CSG Imports also imported three-ply disposable face masks for a blended per-unit cost of $0.37 and sold them with markups ranging from $0.09 to $0.28.\n",
            "KG Imports\n",
            "            Beginning in March 2020, KG Imports also began to import various items of PPE that were stored in warehouses in Lakewood and sold to customers in New Jersey and elsewhere. Until that time, KG Imports had not dealt in such products.\n",
            "            From April 2020 through May 2020, KG Imports offered and sold these items at prices that exceeded prevailing market prices. For example, KG Imports imported three-ply disposable face masks for a blended per-unit cost of $0.37 and sold them with markups ranging from $0.11 to $0.43.\n",
            "As part of the agreements, both CSG Imports and KG Imports agreed to continue to cooperate with the government in any ongoing or future criminal investigations during the term of their respective agreements. \n",
            "The government reached these resolutions with CSG Imports and KG Imports based on a number of factors, including: both entities’ failure to timely and voluntarily self-disclose the conduct that triggered the investigations; the nature and seriousness of the offenses; and credit for each company’s respective cooperation. Both entities also agreed to sell all PPE seized by the government at prices not to exceed their costs in obtaining the PPE and to provide semi-annual written reports to the government regarding their PPE sales.\n",
            "Attorney General William P. Barr created the COVID-19 Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force, led by U.S. Attorney Carpenito, who is coordinating efforts with the Antitrust Division and U.S. Attorneys across the country wherever illegal activity involving protective personal equipment occurs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has issued a Notice designating categories of health and medical supplies that must not be hoarded or sold for exorbitant prices. \n",

            "Karen Chapon, aka Karen Hannafious, 50, of Las Vegas, Nevada, was charged by criminal complaint in the District of Nevada with one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution.  The complaint alleges that, in support of her six fraudulent loan applications, Chapon made numerous false and misleading statements about her companies’ respective business operations and payroll expenses, and falsely denied that she had been convicted of a felony in the past five years.   \n",
            "The complaint also alleges that, in further support of the fraudulent loan applications, Chapon submitted fake and altered documents, including fraudulent federal tax filings.  For example, Chapon misrepresented to a lender that, in 2019, her company Heavenly Tahoe Properties paid several million dollars in employee wages.  In support of Chapon’s loan application, she submitted a fraudulent IRS filing that appeared to be Heavenly Tahoe Properties’ 2019 Form 940 federal unemployment tax return showing that the company paid nearly $2.5 million in employee wages that year.  In reality, the IRS has no record of the company filing any 2019 tax returns, and publicly available records show that the company’s Nevada corporate registration is no longer valid.     \n",
            "The government has executed seizure warrants recovering the majority of the nearly $600,000 in PPP loan proceeds that Chapon obtained in her alleged fraud, including more than $500,000 from the bank account of one of her companies and a Mercedes Benz SUV.      \n",
            "The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted March 29.  It is designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act is the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.\n",
            "The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent.  Businesses must use PPP loan proceeds for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.\n",

Ultimately, an $867,187 loan was approved for Argo Global, Inc.\n",

Manukyan allegedly told law enforcement that he found two of the EDD cards on the street and decided to keep them, but insisted that he never used them. Investigators recovered another $118,474 from debit cards linked to Manukyan.\n",

            "In San Antonio today, Senior U.S. District Court Judge David A. Ezra granted a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) filed by federal authorities against Living Health Holistic Healing Center d/b/a Living Health New Braunfels (Living Health) and it’s owner, Leslie Tatum, to combat alleged fraudulent advertising and testing related to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), announced U.S. Attorney John F. Bash and FBI Special Agent in Charge Christopher Combs, San Antonio Field Office.\n",
            "The purpose of the civil injunction is to stop Tatum, through her business, from advertising, offering and performing COVID-19 testing.  According to a civil complaint filed in this case, Living Health and Tatum have misled the public into believing they are qualified to both administer COVID-19 diagnostic and serological tests and interpret the results of such tests. The defendants operate a website with the domain name “livinghealthnb.com”, a Facebook page, and use direct emails to induce customers into purchasing COVID-19 antibody testing for $85.  The complaint further states that the test used by Tatum is not authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to determine whether individuals have an active COVID-19 infection or whether they should take steps to quarantine or isolate themselves from others.  Moreover, according to the complaint, Tatum, a licensed massage therapist, is not qualified to perform nor evaluate the test results.\n",
            "Today’s action will prevent Tatum from advertising COVID-19 testing through her business’s website and Facebook page immediately while this investigation continues.  It will also prevent her from performing COVID-19 diagnostic or serological tests, or providing services related to the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation, or management of symptoms of COVID-19.  By filing this action, the government is employing a federal statute that permits federal courts to issue injunctions to prevent harm to potential victims of fraudulent schemes.  A hearing on the TRO is scheduled for 9:00am on August 25, 2020, before Judge Ezra.\n",
            "Individuals who were tested for COVID-19 at this facility are asked to contact the FBI by calling (210) 225-6741, prompt #1, or online at www.tips.fbi.gov. Those individuals are also encouraged to contact their primary care physician, local health department, free standing ER, or nearby urgent care facility for re-testing.\n",
            "For the most up-to-date information on COVID-19, consumers may visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO websites.  In addition, the public is urged to report suspected fraud schemes related to COVID-19 by calling the National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) hotline (1-866-720-5721) or by e-mailing the NCDF at disaster@leo.gov.

            "This enforcement action is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Erin M. Van De Walle, Justin Chung and Michael C. Galdo of the Western District of Texas.  Special Agents with the FBI’s San Antonio Field Office are conducting the investigation.\n",
            "The claims made in the complaint are allegations that, if the case were to proceed to trial, the government must prove to receive a permanent injunction against the defendant.\n",

            "A Florida man has been charged regarding allegations that he fraudulently obtained a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan and an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL), and that he orchestrated a conspiracy to submit false and fraudulent claims for reimbursement to Medicare and CareCredit, and to defraud his own patients by charging them thousands of dollars for chiropractic services under false pretenses.\n",

            "Dennis Nobbe, 63, of Miami, Florida, was charged by criminal complaint, unsealed today upon his arrest, in the Southern District of Florida with wire fraud; health care fraud; conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud; making false statements to a financial institution; money laundering; and conspiracy to commit money laundering.  He is expected to make his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge John O’Sullivan at 1 p.m. EST today.\n",
            "The complaint alleges that Nobbe, a chiropractor, orchestrated a scheme to exploit his patients for financial gain through a credit card program intended to help patients pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses.  To conceal his role in the scheme, Nobbe paid bribes to other physicians to open credit card merchant accounts in their names.  Nobbe then encouraged patients at his chiropractic business, Dynamic Medical Services Inc., many of whom were low-income and did not speak English, to apply for the credit cards. \n",
            "According to the complaint, Nobbe charged thousands of dollars to these credit cards for services that he never, or only partially, rendered, leaving patients saddled with debt.  In addition, Nobbe bribed a physician to submit claims to Medicare on Nobbe’s behalf because Nobbe, as a chiropractor, was ineligible to submit the claims himself, and would not have been able to receive reimbursement for the claimed services.  Nobbe and other physicians also allegedly conspired to launder the proceeds from these schemes. \n",
            "As stated in the complaint, Nobbe instructed the physicians to conceal Nobbe’s involvement in the scheme, and sought to conceal the purpose of large wire transfers he received, through the use of shell companies and sham contracts. \n",
            "The complaint further alleges that Nobbe obtained over $200,000 in PPP and EIDL loans intended to provide COVID relief, and that Nobbe transferred portions of the proceeds to shell companies under his control and to pay personal expenses.\n",

            "The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent.  Businesses must use PPP loan proceeds for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses. \n",
            "The EIDL program is designed to provide economic relief to small businesses that are currently experiencing a temporary loss of revenue.  EIDL proceeds can be used to cover a wide array of working capital and normal operating expenses, such as continuation of health care benefits, rent, utilities and fixed debt payments.  If an applicant also obtains a loan under the PPP, the EIDL funds cannot be used as the same purpose as the PPP funds.   \n",

            "BOSTON – United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling announced today that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Special Inspector General Brian D. Miller of the Office of the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR), to investigate and prosecute fraud in the distribution of the massive relief package authorized by the CARES Act.\n",
            "“It’s an unfortunate reality that a certain kind of criminal capitalizes on crises to take advantage of government programs,” said U.S. Attorney Lelling. “Since the outset of this pandemic, my office has worked with our law enforcement partners to disrupt fraudulent schemes targeting the government’s pandemic relief efforts. This partnership with SIGPR marks an important step in enhancing that effort.”\n",
            "The MOU will allow the U.S. Attorney’s Office and SIGPR to enhance their cooperative efforts in investigating and prosecuting matters involving loans, loan guarantees and other investments made by the Secretary of the Treasury under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act of 2020, while using criminal and civil resources efficiently.\n",
            "“I am looking forward to working with United States Attorney Andy Lelling and his team in Boston,” said Special Inspector General Miller. “Identifying fraud and preventing any waste or abuse of the money provided under the CARES Act is a top priority for both of our offices, and we are determined to bring those who attempt to steal from American taxpayers to justice. This partnership, I am confident, will help to ensure the security and efficiency of the CARES Act funds.”\n",
            "The MOU outlines four objectives: 1) to provide a coordinated response to CARES Act funding fraud, with an emphasis on organized criminal activity, as well as criminal and civil fraud affecting federal money, vulnerable victims, and fraud recidivists; 2) to speed up legal process, case intake, and prosecution of CARES Act-related fraud; 3) to link and associate isolated CARES Act-related complaints with larger schemes and related unlawful activity; and 4) to deter future CARES Act funding fraud by increasing awareness of successful criminal prosecutions and civil enforcement actions against individuals and companies involved in CARES-related financial fraud.\n",

            "Date: 7/27/2020\n",
            "Link: https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/us-attorney-mcswain-announces-fraudsters-thwarted-stealing-44-million-state-stimulus\n",
            "Press Release:\n",
            "PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney William M. McSwain announced today that federal and state law enforcement, in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry, and together with measures implemented by US Bank, have successfully prevented over $44 million from reaching criminals who attempted to steal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) funds in Pennsylvania. The U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG) utilized sophisticated data analytics to identify the fraudulent claims. The Department of Labor & Industry provided program assistance and data, and DOL-OIG was supported by the U.S. Attorney’s Office-led Coronavirus Working Group of federal and state law enforcement agencies in Southeastern Pennsylvania, including the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Secret Service, the Social Security Administration Office of Inspector General, and the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General.\n",
            "PUA is funded entirely by federal dollars under the CARES Act and the program is administered by the state. Data analytics enabled DOL-OIG and the other law enforcement agencies to trace clusters of fraudulent claims for PUA funds back to the same criminals. The Department of Labor & Industry then used the information to stop the payment of PUA funds to those criminals.\n",
            "The outstanding work of law enforcement saved over $28 million in PUA funds that would have been paid to fraudsters by check or direct deposit. In addition, US Bank administers the Pennsylvania debit card program used to make some PUA payments. US Bank applied analytics to identify an additional $16 million in fraudulent claims, and those funds will be returned to the Pennsylvania Department of Treasury.\n",
            "Many of the fraudsters stole identities of real Pennsylvanians to file their fraudulent claims. Law enforcement’s ability to track the fraud was greatly enhanced by Pennsylvanians who came forward and reported that they had received PUA funds but had never applied for them. Anyone who receives state unemployment compensation funds that they did not apply for, whether by check, direct deposit or debit card, are probably victims of identity theft. If you find yourself in that position, U.S. Attorney McSwain strongly encourages you to report it immediately to the Department of Labor & Industry and return the funds.\n",
            "“Pandemic Unemployment Assistance funds are intended to help Pennsylvanians who lost their jobs because of the coronavirus,” said U.S. Attorney Bill McSwain. “Thieves who attempt to take these funds are taking advantage of others’ misfortune – ripping them off while also ripping off all taxpayers who fund the program. I want to commend the outstanding cooperation and coordination among federal and state agencies, and private banking institutions, that together achieved this remarkable success. The U.S. Attorney’s Office Coronavirus Working Group enables us to combine the tremendous resources and skill of federal and state law enforcement to do what it takes to bring these criminals to justice.” \n",
            "“The ongoing work of this joint task force has prevented criminals from stealing tens of millions of dollars meant for out-of-work Pennsylvanians,” Attorney General Josh Shapiro said. “If you receive unemployment compensation you did not apply for, notify state officials right away. With your help we will take down these sophisticated scammers who are trying to use the COVID-19 pandemic for their own selfish, illegal, gain.”\n",
            "“Criminals continue to exploit the Unemployment Insurance program for personal gain, and with selfish disregard for their fellow citizens. Fraud against the UI program distracts state workforce agencies from serving individuals in need of assistance, and siphons taxpayer funds from those who are qualified and eligible to receive UI benefits. The Office of Inspector General will continue to work closely with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry, and our many law enforcement partners, to see to it that these criminals are sought out and held accountable,” said Derek Pickle, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge, Philadelphia Region, U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General.\n",
            "U.S. Attorney McSwain and Acting Special Agent-in-Charge Pickle identified the following potentially fraudulent activities for Pennsylvanians to be alert to:\n",
            "\n",
            "You have not applied for unemployment benefits but you receive a PA Treasury check or direct deposit or a debit card issued by US Bank that you did not know about or apply for.\n",
            "You receive correspondence from the PA Department of Labor & Industry or the PA Department of Treasury about receiving unemployment assistance that you did not apply for.\n",
            "Someone comes to your home that you do not know and tells you that their unemployment assistance check or debit card was mistakenly mailed to you.\n",
            "Someone asks you to use your bank account to deposit their unemployment assistance.\n",
            "Someone, in person or electronically, tells you that you are entitled to unemployment assistance and requests personal identifying information from you.\n",
            "Someone offers to help you file for unemployment benefits for a fee.\n",
            "Someone claims to be from the government and asks for a fee or personal information to complete your PUA application.\n",
            "\n",
            "If any of these suspicious activities happen to you, you should not assist or confront the fraudster.

            "Press Release:\n",
            "Utah resident Gordon H. Pedersen has been indicted for posing as a medical doctor to sell a baseless treatment for coronavirus (COVID-19).  According to the indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Salt Lake City late last week, Pedersen fraudulently promoted and sold ingestible silver-based products as a cure for COVID-19 despite having no evidence that his products could treat or cure the disease.  Pedersen is also alleged to have claimed to be a physician and worn a stethoscope and white lab coat in videos and photos posted on the Internet to further his alleged fraud scheme.\n",
            "In a related matter, the company Pedersen previously co-owned, My Doctor Suggests LLC (My Doctor Suggests), has agreed to plead guilty to a one-count criminal information related to its false and misleading marketing of ingestible silver products as a drug treatment for COVID-19.  The company has severed ties with Pedersen and agreed to cooperate in his prosecution.  The criminal information filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah are part of a global resolution with My Doctor Suggests that also includes a civil consent order requiring the company to cease fraudulently labeling its products and to issue full refunds to affected consumers.\n",
            "“The Department of Justice will take swift action to protect consumers from those who offer phony cure-alls for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Ethan Davis.  “We will continue to work closely with our partners at the Food and Drug Administration to quickly shut down schemes to promote and sell unlawful products during this pandemic.”\n",
            "“In addition to the imposition of a civil restraining order that successfully shut down fraudulent claims of a COVID-19 cure-all, Mr. Pedersen now faces criminal charges for his conduct.  The federal felony allegations are serious, especially against the backdrop of this pandemic where Americans are yearning for effective relief.  If proven, this conduct reveals a scheme where greed was a higher priority than conveying truth to consumers,” said U.S. Attorney John W. Huber for the District of Utah.\n",
            "The indictment against Pedersen alleges that, beginning in early 2020, he conducted a scheme to defraud consumers throughout the United States, by falsely presenting himself as a medical doctor and promoting and selling silver products on the Internet based on fraudulent claims of protection against, and treatment for, COVID-19, in the midst of a worldwide pandemic.\n",
            "According to the criminal information filed Friday, My Doctor Suggests made false and misleading claims that the company’s silver-based products could be ingested to protect against COVID-19 and the products lacked the necessary directions for use as a drug product.  The information also allege My Doctor Suggests operated without properly registering with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  It is anticipated My Doctor Suggests will plead guilty to a single misdemeanor count of distributing misbranded drug products in interstate commerce in violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n",
            "“The FDA is actively monitoring the marketplace for fraudulent products represented as preventing, curing, or treating COVID-19.  Americans expect and deserve treatments that are safe, effective and meet appropriate standards, and the agency will continue to bring to justice those who place profits above the public health during this pandemic,” said Judy McMeekin, Pharm.D., Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder that we will take action against those who jeopardize the health of Americans while taking advantage of a crisis.”\n",
            "The Department of Justice previously sought and obtained an emergency court order in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, alleging in its civil complaint that My Doctor Suggests worked with two co-defendants, Pedersen and his company GP Silver LLC, to fraudulently promote and sell various silver products for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.  Subsequent orders temporarily enjoined Pedersen, GP Silver LLC, and My Doctor Suggests from distributing silver products as well as representing they could cure, mitigate, treat, or otherwise prevent COVID-19 or any other disease. The recent consent order permanently enjoins My Doctor Suggests LLC from making these representations, and it provides a notification and refund process for deceived consumers.   \n",
            "The consent order specifically requires that My Doctor Suggests LLC permanently stop any fraudulent promotions, clearly and conspicuously disavow any statement that its silver products treat or prevent COVID-19 in future marketing materials and consumer notices, implement robust compliance measures to prevent a reoccurrence, and provide full refunds upon request to any customer who purchased its silver products under fraudulent pretenses.  Affected customers can contact My Doctor Suggests LLC at (1-866- 660-9868) or refunds@mydoctorsuggests.com.\n",
            "An indictment is an accusation by a federal grand jury and is not evidence of guilt.  The defendant should be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n",
            "The criminal action is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacob Strain from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Utah with assistance from Trial Attorney Matt Lash from the Department of Justice, Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and James Smith from the FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel.  The criminal case was investigated by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations and the FBI’s Utah Field Office.\n",
            "The civil enforcement action was handled by Trial Attorneys Speare I. Hodges and Sarah Williams of the Department of Justice, Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Joel A. Ferre, with support from FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations.\n",

Rabbitt at of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington.\n",
            "Mukund Mohan, 48, of Clyde Hill, Washington, was charged by criminal complaint, unsealed today after he was taken into custody, in the Western District of Washington with one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering.  He is expected to make his initial appearance before U.S. Chief Magistrate Judge Brian A. Tsuchida at 2 p.m. PDT today.\n",
            "The complaint alleges that Mohan submitted at least eight fraudulent PPP loan applications on behalf of six different companies to federally insured financial institutions.  The complaint alleges that, in support of the fraudulent loan applications, Mohan made numerous false and misleading statements about the companies’ respective business operations and payroll expenses. \n",
            "The complaint also alleges that, in further support of the fraudulent loan applications, Mohan submitted fake and altered documents, including fake federal tax filings and altered incorporation documents.  For example, Mohan misrepresented to a lender that, in 2019, his company Mahenjo Inc., had dozens of employees and paid millions of dollars in employee wages and payroll taxes.  In support of Mahenjo’s loan application, Mohan submitted incorporation documents showing that he incorporated the company in 2018 and filed federal unemployment tax forms for 2019.  In truth, Mohan purchased Mahenjo on the Internet in May 2020 and, at time he purchased the company, it had no employees and no business activity.  The incorporation documents he submitted to the lender were altered and the federal tax filings he submitted were fake. \n",
            "The complaint further alleges that Mohan transferred at least $231,000 in fraudulently-obtained loan proceeds to his personal brokerage account for his personal benefit.\n",
            "The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted March 29.  It is designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act is the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.\n",
            "The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent.  Businesses must use PPP loan proceeds for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.\n",

            "As the letter explains, the demand for monoclonal antibodies targeting COVID-19 is likely to exceed what any one firm could produce on its own.  Moreover, waiting until regulators approve specific treatments before scaling up manufacturing might delay access to these potentially life-saving medicines by many months, which adversely could affect the nation’s efforts to fight COVID-19.  The Requesting Parties aim to address both problems by sharing information about their manufacturing facilities, capacity, raw materials and supplies that could be used to produce successful COVID-19 monoclonal antibody treatments subject to important safeguards and limits, so that facilities can be ready to manufacture treatments once they prove safe and effective. Among other competitive safeguards, they have committed that they will not exchange information related to the prices of those treatments or the costs of inputs for or production of those treatments.  Their efforts likely will expedite and expand the overall production of monoclonal antibody treatments targeting COVID-19 in a way that is unlikely to lessen competition.\n",
            "“This critical collaboration will help Americans get access to potentially life-saving therapeutics sooner than otherwise would be possible,” Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said.  “It also will help preserve Americans’ ability to benefit from the free market competition that drives innovation and access to drugs in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry.”\n",
            "The Requesting Parties submitted their business review request pursuant to the expedited, temporary review procedure detailed in the Joint Antitrust Statement Regarding COVID-19 (the “Joint Statement”) issued on March 24 by both the Department and the Federal Trade Commission.  According to the Joint Statement, the Department will aim to resolve COVID-19-related business review requests like this one within seven (7) calendar days of receiving all necessary information. \n",

After a 30-day waiting period, any documents supporting the business review will be added to the file, unless a basis for their exclusion for reasons of confidentiality has been established under the business review procedure. Supporting documents in the file will be maintained for a period of one year, and copies will be available upon request to the FOIA/Privacy Act Unit, Antitrust Documents Group at atrdocs.grp@usdoj.gov.\n",

            "Wagner Sozi, 32, was indicted on two counts of wire fraud, one count of aggravated identity theft and one count of making a false claim to the United States. Sozi was initially charged by criminal complaint and arrested on June 25, 2020. He was released on conditions following a detention hearing before U.S. Magistrate Court Judge David H. Hennessy on June 30, 2020.\n",
            "Charging documents allege that Sozi engaged in a scheme to use stolen identity information to open accounts, make purchases, rent cars and apply for PUA benefits. Sozi allegedly obtained this stolen identity information from various sources, including from a Cambridge realty company that collected the personal identifying information of people who sought to rent local apartments. Sozi lived with an individual who had worked for this realty company, and agents found various files belonging to the company in Sozi’s apartment. Numerous identity theft victims tied to Sozi had been clients of this realty company, including at least one person in whose name a fraudulent PUA claim was filed.\n",
            "Court documents reflect that Sozi, along with a female accomplice, opened credit accounts at an office supply retailer under various fake identities and then used these accounts to purchase Visa gift cards, resulting in a loss to the retail chain of more than $100,000. Sozi allegedly used another stolen identity to purchase a Rolex for more than $15,000. It is further alleged that he also possessed a Maine driver’s license, bearing his photograph and the name of an identity theft victim, which was used to open a bank account and to make large purchases at an Apple Store.\n",
            "Following his arrest on June 25, 2020, agents seized documents from Sozi’s apartment, including a PUA debit card in another individual’s name. Further investigation revealed that the PUA claim associated with the seized debit card listed Sozi’s address as the mailing address and that another fraudulent PUA claim had been submitted under Sozi’s own name but with another person’s Social Security number.\n",
            "The charges of wire fraud provide for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. The charge of aggravated identity theft provides for a mandatory consecutive sentence of two years in prison, up to one year of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. The false claim charge provides for a sentence of up to three years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000.

Ford, has recently received reports suggesting that personal identifying information of some present and past Nevada residents is being used to file fraudulent applications for unemployment benefits.\n",
            "Potential victims typically learn of these suspected unlawful activities when either they receive a letter from the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation (DETR) relating to an application for benefits they never sought, and/or their employer receives a similar notification from DETR.\n",
            "“The COVID-19 Task Force is committed to protecting the integrity of the unemployment benefits program,” said U.S. Attorney Nicholas A. Trutanich. “We will continue working closely with our law enforcement partners and colleagues on the Task Force to safeguard the program for Nevadans facing difficult situations who need our help.”\n",

            "Do not carry your Social Security Card in your wallet.\n",

            "Ask how you can remove unnecessary information or information that is not required for the service you are receiving.\n",
            "Check credit reports, banking information, medical information that may have details that need to be removed or secured.\n",

            "Charged is Brandi Hawkins, 39.\n",
            "According to the complaint, Brandi Hawkins was a contract employee for the State of Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency.  Her duties included reviewing, processing and verifying the legitimacy of unemployment insurance claims.\n",
            "Beginning in April, 2020, it is alleged that Hawkins used her insider access to fraudulently release payment on hundreds of fraudulent claims.  Hawkins actions resulted in the fraudulent disbursement of over $2,000,000 of federal and state funds intended for unemployment assistance during the pandemic.  Over $200,000 in cash was seized from her residence during a search warrant.  Hawkins is alleged to have used proceeds from her crimes to purchase high-end handbags and other luxury goods.\n",

            "“The U.S. Secret Service is currently focused on criminals attempting to exploit the American people during these unprecedented times of record unemployment due to the pandemic. It is especially egregious when someone in a position of trust, working for an agency created to assist the residents of the State of Michigan, takes advantage of those during their time of need. We will continue to work with our federal and state partners to bring these perpetrators to justice”, said Douglas Zloto, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Secret Service - Detroit Field Office.\n",

            "“Brandi Hawkins’ alleged actions are incredibly selfish and without regard for her fellow Michiganders in dire need of financial assistance,” said Sarah Kull, IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge, Detroit Field Office.  “IRS-CI will not hesitate to thoroughly investigate any COVID19 related fraud and bring those offenders to justice.”\n",
            "Richard Sheehan, Acting Postal Inspector in Charge of the Detroit Division said, “This investigation was an excellent example of a partnership between federal law enforcement agencies, working together to bring down this fraud conspiracy. I fully commend the hard work and countless hours put forth by all of the agencies involved, which resulted in bringing Brandi Hawkins to justice.”\n",
            "“We appreciate U.S. Attorney Schneider‘s quick action to bring this case to justice. The Unemployment Insurance Agency will continue to work closely with state and federal partners to identify unemployment fraud that can be quickly turned over to law enforcement for prosecution,” stated Jeffrey Frost, Special Fraud Advisor, Michigan Dept. of Labor and Economic Opportunity, Unemployment Insurance Agency.\n",

            "Tubbs appeared this afternoon before United States Magistrate Judge Thomas Ray and was released on bond.

            "         A criminal complaint unsealed in court this afternoon charges Marnell with one count of bank fraud and alleges he obtained more than $8 million in PPP loans through applications to insured financial institutions, and others, on behalf of different companies. During today’s court hearing, prosecutors said they now believe Marnell received approximately $9 million in fraudulent loans – a number that could rise as the investigation continues.\n",

In April, Congress authorized more than $300 billion in additional PPP funding.\n",

Scott announced.\n",
            "According to the indictment, Huu Tieu, 58, is the president and chief executive officer of Golden Sunrise Pharmaceutical Inc. and Golden Sunrise Nutraceutical Inc., both headquartered in Porterville. From at least April 25 to July 9, through his companies, Tieu marketed and sold a package of herbal mixtures dubbed the “Emergency D-Virus Plan of Care,” which he claimed treated COVID-19. In materials posted on the companies’ websites and Facebook pages and in emails to the media, Tieu made a series of false statements about the Emergency D-Virus Plan of Care, including:\n",
            "\n",
            "That one of the mixtures in the product, called “ImunStem,” was the first dietary supplement in the United States to be FDA approved as a prescription medicine to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and had specifically been approved to treat COVID‑19. In reality, the FDA has never approved any Golden Sunrise product for any intended use and, on at least two occasions, has told Tieu in writing that ImunStem is not FDA approved; and\n",
            "That ImunStem was designated as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) under the 21st Century Cures Act. In reality, the FDA never granted an RMAT designation to any Golden Sunrise product, denied Tieu’s request for an RMAT designation for ImunStem in 2017, and reiterated that denial to Tieu in writing in 2019.\n",
            "\n",
            "According to the indictment, Tieu made these misrepresentations for the purpose of soliciting customers, both patients and health care professionals, to acquire Golden Sunrise products so that he could submit reimbursement claims to the patients’ insurers, including Medicare and Medi-Cal. Tieu dispensed his products to customers in the Porterville area and also shipped the products to other parts of California and the United States.\n",
            "On May 8, an undercover investigator with the Tulare County District Attorney’s Office met with Tieu in person, telling him her mother was 68 and very sick with COVID-19. The investigator asked Tieu if she should take her mother to the hospital. Tieu responded, “No. You cannot go in there,” and instead, encouraged her to use Golden Sunrise products.\n",
            "“The FDA is actively monitoring the marketplace for fraudulent products claiming to treat COVID-19. Americans expect and deserve treatments that are safe, effective and meet appropriate standards, and the agency will continue to bring to justice those who place profits above the public health during this pandemic,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “We commend the efforts of our law enforcement partners in this investigation and today’s announcement should serve as a reminder that we will take appropriate action against those who jeopardize the health of Americans while taking advantage of a crisis.”\n",

Assistant U.S. Attorneys Vincente Tennerelli and Alexandre Dempsey are prosecuting the case.\n",
            "If convicted, Tieu faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine on the mail fraud counts and three years in prison and a $10,000 fine on the misbranding counts. Any sentence, however, would be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables.

The lawsuit names Luke John Flint, of Louisville, Kentucky, doing business through “coronavaccine.center”, “coronavaccine.today”; “coronatesting.site”; “coronatesting.center”; “coronavaccine.shop”; “coronavaccine.club”; and “covid19vaccine.center. Today a federal judge entered an order prohibiting Flint and others associated with the websites from committing wire fraud, maintaining and doing business through the websites and social media, and destroying business records.\n",
            "According to the civil complaint, the purpose of these websites, which contain several false statements, is to induce victims to pay Flint and those working in concert with him for a non-existent vaccine for COVID-19 amid the global pandemic. There is currently no known FDA approved COVID-19 vaccine. The website and related Facebook page lists the Corona Vaccine Center’s address as 545 South Clay Street, Louisville, KY, which is nothing more than an empty parking lot/field.\n",
            "The civil complaint further alleges that Flint is not a licensed medical professional and he is not registered with the FDA to investigate or develop a COVID-19 vaccine, and as such, he could not legally distribute a vaccine. When interviewed by federal agents, Flint admitted that there is no known FDA approved vaccine for COVID-19 and that he is unaware if and when one would become available. During this interview, Flint also admitted that he is not a licensed medical professional and is not registered with the FDA to distribute a vaccine for COVID-19, if and when one becomes available.\n",

            "July 8, 2020\n",

            " \n",
            "Millions of Americans and small businesses are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  In response, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act.  This historic legislation, which included over $2 trillion in emergency financial assistance, was designed to provide immediate help for small businesses, healthcare providers, and individuals. \n",
            "The CARES Act includes the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), which provides nearly $650 billion in loans to small businesses, as well as Economic Impact Payments (“EIPs”) to provide relief to individual taxpayers and families.  The CARES Act also included other programs to help small and medium-sized businesses, and assistance to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the front lines of the coronavirus response. \n",
            "This federal response to the current crisis is vital to the economy, but like many good federal programs, there is risk of fraud.  For example, the PPP requires borrowers to make certain certifications regarding their eligibility and the use of the funds, but some borrowers make misrepresentations in bad faith.  When fraudsters unlawfully take money to which they are not entitled, they deplete the program and divert funds from those who need it most.  The Department of Justice (“DOJ”) is committed to pursuing wrongdoing related to COVID-19, including these fraudulent schemes.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Texas (“EDTX”) shares this priority and will deploy all criminal and civil enforcement tools available to combat such misconduct.\n",
            "In the few short months since passage of the CARES Act, we have initiated multiple criminal actions and investigations.  We are pursuing individuals who used stolen identities to obtain EIPs.  We also have partnered with the DOJ’s Criminal Division to charge several individuals who, as alleged, knowingly provided false information to obtain millions of dollars in PPP loans.  In one case, rather than using PPP funds for purposes authorized by the CARES Act, the funds were allegedly used to purchase luxury vehicles and to fund personal investment accounts.  In addition to criminal efforts, we are looking to the False Claims Act (“FCA”), a powerful civil statute that allows the United States to recoup money that has been lost due to fraud.  The FCA allows the government to obtain treble damages and civil penalties from those who defraud federal programs, such as the CARES Act.\n",
            "We will be vigorous in our enforcement efforts.  Even so, we recognize that some businesses have voiced concerns about increasingly complicated program rules and regulations creating traps not only for the unwary, but for the many companies that sought assistance in good faith.  For example, some have predicted False Claims Act litigation based on inadvertent foot faults or regulatory defects—a risk that could increase with additional disclosures of funding recipients, investigative reporting, and public criticism.  Rest assured that we will be careful not to discourage legitimate businesses from accessing the important financial resources that Congress made available through the CARES Act.  We will not punish companies that accessed stimulus funds in good faith compliance with the rules.  Nor, will we seek out applicants who made technical mistakes in processing paperwork or honestly misunderstood regulatory or certification requirements.  Our focus is on fraud.\n",
            "So, what can the public do?  Simply put, if you see something, say something.  Report borrowers who knowingly provided false information in loan applications, individuals who unlawfully obtained EIPs, and those who knowingly misused CARES Act funds.  We are working with banks and other financial institutions to help identify potential fraudsters.  But we also need the public’s assistance.  If you know of, or suspect, fraud related to the CARES Act, please contact the National Disaster Fraud Hotline at (866) 720-5721.\n",
            "The EDTX and our law enforcement partners are ready to take on those who attempt to illegally profit from the coronavirus pandemic.  And we need your help to wage this fight.\n",

            "SALT LAKE CITY – A federal complaint unsealed last week charges the owner of a Utah trucking company with submitting a fraudulent loan application to get a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan of $210,000 through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.\n",
            "Hubert Ivan Ugarte, 52, of Draper, with the assistance of Lisa Bradshaw Rowberry, 49, of Provo, Utah, submitted a loan application to the Small Business Administration (SBA) to obtain the PPP loan, according to the complaint.\n",
            "The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans suffering from the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $249 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized more than $300 billion in additional PPP funding.\n",
            "The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be entirely forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds and uses a certain amount of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.\n",
            "According to the complaint, Ugarte, with Rowberry’s assistance, answered “no” to questions on the application asking whether he was under formal criminal charges in any jurisdiction. His answer was false because he was under federal indictment in Utah when he answered the question, the complaint alleges.\n",
            "On Oct. 24, 2019, a federal grand jury in Utah returned an indictment charging Ugarte and others following a multi-year wire fraud and bribery scheme investigation in which it is alleged Ugarte bribed employees at the Salt Lake City Hub of FedEx ground to obtain preferential treatment for his trucking companies.  Ugarte faces four counts of wire fraud and six counts of money laundering in the pending case.\n",
            "In filling out PPP loan application documents, Ugarte also circled “no” when asked if he had ever been placed on pretrial diversion.  In fact, according to the complaint, he entered into a two-year pretrial diversion in 1988 to resolve a felony drug possession charge.\n",
            "Before Ugarte and Rowberry completed the Borrower Certification for the PPP loan and submitted it to the SBA, Ugarte specifically agreed that at least 75 percent of the $210,000 loan would be used for payroll costs.\n",
            "According to the complaint, the original PPP loan application was rejected or declined by two banks after they had discovered Ugarte was under federal indictment. The complaint alleges Rowberry told an individual she was going to go with a friend she knew in the banking industry to re-apply for the PPP loan. On May 14, 2020, Ugarte received $210,000 from Transportation Alliance Bank.\n",
            "Instead of using at least 75 percent of the loan to pay payroll costs, including bounced payroll checks, Ugarte’s business account shows an automatic withdrawal to Kenworth Sales in the amount of $126,965.27 just four days after the loan was received.  The complaint alleges Ugarte’s company owed approximately $66,000 a month in lease or purchase payments to Kenworth for 13 tractors. Records show Kenworth received the money for truck payments and  small amount for various truck parts. The complaint alleges Ugarte used 60 percent of the loan to pay the past due truck payments – leaving 40 percent for payroll costs.\n",
            "Ugarte and Rowberry are charged with conspiracy, removal of property to prevent seizure, loan application fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering in the complaint. The conspiracy and removal of property to prevent seizure counts each carry potential 5 years sentences.  Money laundering has a potential 10 year sentence and wire fraud is up to 20 years. The loan application fraud count is up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.\n",
            "The removal of property to prevent seizure count in the complaint alleges Ugarte received a payment of $60,957.82 for a wrecked tractor in Nevada after Rowberry submitted an insurance claim.  The check should have been turned over to the FBI subject to a seizure warrant in his FedEx fraud case. Rather than turn the money over to the FBI, the complaint alleges Rowberry deposited it into one of Ugarte’s accounts.  \n",
            "Rowberry had an initial appearance last week in federal court and has been released on conditions of pretrial release.  A preliminary hearing for her is set for July 28, 2020, at 3 p.m.  before Magistrate Judge Daphne A. Oberg.  An initial appearance for Ugarte, who is in custody, is set for Tuesday (July 14, 2020) at 9 a.m. before Magistrate Oberg.\n",
            "Complaints are not findings of guilt.  Individuals charged in complaints are presumed innocent unless or until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in court.\n",

            "Defendants Allegedly Attempted to Avoid Government Regulation by Selling Products Through a Company They Deceptively Named Genesis II Church   \n",
            "Miami, Fl. – Federal prosecutors in Miami have charged four Florida residents who allegedly marketed “Miracle Mineral Solution,” a toxic bleach, as a cure for COVID-19, with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to violate the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and criminal contempt. \n",
            "Ariana Fajardo Orshan, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and Catherine Hermsen, Assistant Commissioner of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, made the announcement. \n",
            "According to the criminal complaint affidavit, Mark Grenon, 62, and his sons, Jonathan Grenon, 34, Jordan Grenon, 26, and Joseph Grenon, 32, all of Bradenton, Florida, manufacture, promote, and sell Miracle Mineral Solution (“MMS”), a chemical solution containing sodium chlorite and water. The Grenons allegedly directed their customers to ingest MMS orally, which causes the solution to become chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleach, typically used for industrial water treatment or bleaching textiles, pulp, and paper.  FDA has received reports of people requiring hospitalizations, developing life-threatening conditions, and dying after drinking MMS.\n",
            "According to the affidavit, the Grenons claim that MMS can treat, prevent, and cure COVID-19.  The FDA, however, has not approved MMS for treatment of COVID-19, or for any other use.  Rather, in prior official warning statements, the FDA has strongly urged consumers not to purchase or use MMS, explaining that drinking MMS is the same as drinking bleach and can cause dangerous side effects, including severe vomiting, diarrhea, and life-threatening low blood pressure. See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/danger-dont-drink-miracle-mineral-solution-or-similar-products.\n",
            "The affidavit also alleges that, before marketing MMS as a cure for COVID-19, the Grenons marketed MMS as a miracle cure-all for dozens of other serious diseases and disorders, including cancer, Alzheimer’s, autism, multiple sclerosis, and HIV/AIDS, even though the FDA had not approved MMS for any use. The Grenons allegedly sold tens of thousands of bottles of MMS nationwide, including to consumers throughout South Florida. They sold this dangerous product under the guise of Genesis II Church of Health and Healing (“Genesis”), an entity they allegedly created in an attempt to avoid government regulation of MMS. According to the charging documents, Genesis’ own websites describe Genesis as a “non-religious church,” and Defendant Mark Grenon, the co-founder of Genesis, has repeatedly acknowledged that Genesis “has nothing to do with religion,” and that he founded Genesis to “legalize the use of MMS” and avoid “going [ ] to jail.”\n",
            "In addition to charging these defendants with federal conspiracy, the complaint also charges the Grenons with criminal contempt. The United States previously filed a civil case against the defendants and Genesis II Church of Health and Healing. See United States v. Genesis II Church of Health and Healing, et al., Case No. 20-21601-CV-WILLIAMS. In that civil case, the United States obtained court orders halting the Grenons’ distribution of MMS. The criminal charges against the Grenons allege that they willfully violated these court orders. According to the complaint affidavit, the Grenons sent letters to the judge presiding over the civil case saying that they would not comply with the Court’s orders. The Grenons also threatened violence in the letters. The criminal complaint affidavit quotes from these letters.\n",
            "“We continue to protect the public from criminal conduct that takes advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Ariana Fajardo Orshan, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. “Not only is this MMS product toxic, but its distribution and use may prevent those who are sick from receiving the legitimate healthcare they need. A United States District Court already has ordered the defendants to stop distributing this product; we will not sit idly by as individuals purposefully violate Court orders and put the public in danger.”\n",
            "“Making claims that unproven drugs, especially potentially dangerous and unapproved chlorine dioxide products, can cure or prevent COVID-19 or any other disease is unacceptable. The Genesis II Church of Health and Healing has actively and deliberately placed consumers at risk with their fraudulent Miracle Mineral Solution and Americans expect and deserve medical treatments that have been scientifically proven to be safe and effective,” said Catherine Hermsen, Assistant Commissioner of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations. “We commend the efforts of our law enforcement partners for vigorously investigating this matter. The FDA will continue our efforts to make sure these and other like-minded sellers do not jeopardize the health of Americans during this pandemic and in the future.”\n",
            "U.S. Attorney Fajardo Orshan commended the efforts of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, particularly its Miami Field Office. Assistant United States Attorneys Michael B. Homer and John Shipley are prosecuting this case.\n",
            "A criminal complaint is a charging instrument containing allegations.  A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.\n",
            "Related court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida at www.flsd.uscourts.gov or at http://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov, under case number 20-MJ-03050.\n",

            "Link: https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdnc/pr/federal-seizure-warrants-freeze-funds-tied-covid-19-unemployment-fraud-scheme\n",
            "Press Release:\n",
            "CHARLOTTE, N.C. – The U.S. Attorney’s Office has taken swift action to seize $48,742.50 in funds held at bank accounts allegedly used to perpetuate COVID-19 unemployment fraud, announced U.S. Attorney Andrew Murray.  The federal asset forfeiture seizure warrants executed by the United States Secret Service were unsealed by the Court today.\n",
            "Reginald A. DeMatteis, Special Agent in Charge of the United States Secret Service, Charlotte Field Office, joins U.S. Attorney Murray in making today’s announcement.\n",
            "In a memorandum issued on March 16, 2020, Attorney General William P. Bar directed U.S. Attorney’s Offices across the country to remain vigilant in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting wrongdoing related to COVID-19, and to prioritize the investigation and prosecution of criminal conduct exploiting the coronavirus epidemic.\n",
            "In making today’s announcement, U.S. Attorney Murray said, “We will not allow scammers to profit from the COVID-19 crisis. Federal prosecutors in this Office have been working closely with federal, state and local authorities to ensure that we swiftly investigate possible misconduct related to the coronavirus, and use all enforcement tools available to end the fraud and punish the perpetrators.”\n",
            "“Today’s announcement illustrates the Secret Service’s commitment to combating COVID-19 unemployment fraud,” said Special Agent in Charge DeMatteis. “The actions taken by the Secret Service and the U.S. Attorney’s Office prevented legitimate unemployment funds from getting into the wrong hands. The Secret Service will continue to work closely with the U.S. Attorney’s Office to investigate and prosecute criminals who attempt to defraud the critical COVID-19 relief programs and the American taxpayer.”\n",
            "As alleged in the affidavit filed in support of the federal warrants, the seizures stem from an ongoing investigation of a COVID-19 unemployment fraud scheme that implicates bank accounts in the Western District of North Carolina.  These bank accounts were allegedly used to transfer money from unemployment benefit programs to fraudsters. Both the federal government and state governments have recently implemented unemployment benefit programs to disburse money to certain qualifying individuals who have become unemployed as a result of the recent coronavirus outbreak.  These programs provide means for impacted individuals to apply online for unemployment benefits and to receive much-needed funds.  In some instances, fraudsters have targeted these benefit programs and have exploited them for their benefit. \n",
            "According to allegations in the affidavit, to carry out the scheme, the fraudsters used victims’ stolen identities to apply for unemployment benefits online. The scammers then used the bank accounts of yet another set of unsuspecting individuals as “money mule” accounts, to receive and transfer the stolen benefits. “Money mule accounts” are bank accounts used by fraudsters as a pass through means of moving fraudulently-obtained funds. Oftentimes, the unwitting money mule victims, typically acting at the direction of the fraudsters, receive fraud proceeds and conduct financial transactions with those proceeds, or transfer the money from the money mule account to other bank accounts, often located overseas. In many instances, the account holders are not aware they are being exploited to carry out financial fraud.\n",
            "As alleged in the federal affidavit, in some instances in this case, the individuals who opened the money mule accounts believed themselves to be engaged in online romantic relationships with the fraudsters.  The funds identified for seizure in this case were deposited as a result of fraud on coronavirus-related unemployment benefit programs, into many such money mule accounts, including accounts purportedly opened by individuals in the Western District of North Carolina.\n",
            "Commending the investigative work of the United States Secret Service, U.S. Attorney Murray said, “I thank the U.S. Secret Service for acting quickly to stop this fraud. My office will continue to with work federal, state, and local law enforcement and stakeholder banks, to make sure domestic or foreign criminals do not profit from pillaging important COVID-19 relief programs.”\n",
            "U.S. Attorney Murray also noted that the public plays an important role in stopping COVID-19 fraud and urged everyone to remain alert about possible coronavirus scams. “If you are engaged in an online-only relationship and your paramour asks you to open a new bank account, or use your existing account to transfer funds, think twice. A fraudster posing as a romantic online partner could be using you and your accounts as a repository to launder stolen money. Don’t let a scammer turn you into a money mule. Be extra vigilant about online scams, and if the circumstances are suspicious get in touch with law enforcement right away.” \n",
            "The U.S. Secret Service is in charge of the investigation, which is ongoing.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Bain-Creed, of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Charlotte, is handling the federal civil court proceedings.\n",
            "The Department of Justice remains vigilant in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting wrongdoing related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Under the leadership of Attorney General Barr, U.S. Attorneys appointed Coronavirus Fraud Coordinators to work with federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement partners to protect the public from scammers who are attempting to prey upon fears. If you think you are a victim of a scam or attempted fraud involving COVID-19, you can report the fraud by calling the Department of Justice’s National Center for Disaster Fraud Hotline at 866-720-5721 or via the NCDF Web Complaint Form.  Members of the public in the Western District of North Carolina are also encouraged to call 704-344-6222 to reach their local Coronavirus Fraud Coordinator.\n",

            "“Where there is crisis, criminals see opportunity. Fraudsters won’t hesitate to fill their pockets with money intended for hard working Oklahomans who have lost their jobs during this current health crisis,” said U.S. Attorney Trent Shores. “My Coronavirus Anti-Fraud Team will continue to partner with the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office, the U.S. Department of Labor, and local, state, tribal and federal law enforcement to investigate and shut down these unscrupulous networks.”\n",
            "“The Office of Inspector General is committed to safeguarding the Unemployment Insurance program on behalf of taxpayers and vulnerable Americans in need of assistance. We will continue to work vigorously alongside our law enforcement and state workforce agency partners to pursue criminals who seek to exploit the Unemployment Insurance program for personal gain,” said Steven Grell, Special Agent-in-Charge, Dallas Region, U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General.\n",
            "“I am proud of the efficiency at which the task force has worked since being formed,” said Attorney General Mike Hunter. “Although we have accomplished a lot in a short period of time, there is much more to be done, which includes finding those responsible and holding them accountable. I look forward to continuing this important work with the other agencies involved as we remain focused on the best interests of Oklahomans.”\n",
            "The Department took action to block the London IP addresses and several other foreign IP addresses from accessing and fraudulently filing claims through the OESC. Additionally, investigators located businesses regularly named by fraudsters when filing the fraudulent claims. For example, 2,450 unemployment claims were filed naming one Oklahoma business as the employer, but in actuality, the business employs fewer than 10 employees. The business along with multiple individuals whose names were fraudulently used to file the claims reside in the Northern District of Oklahoma.\n",
            "In order to stop these fraudsters, U.S. Attorney Shores and Attorney General Hunter encourage Oklahomans to report any unemployment notices they receive from the OESC that were filed fraudulently in their names.\n",
            "If you or a family member receive a notice about unemployment insurance benefits from the OESC and/or a prepaid MasterCard debit card for Oklahoma unemployment insurance benefits, and it is related to a fraudulent application, please do the following:\n",
            "1. Scan and save the documents containing the OESC notice and the debit card, if you receive a card.\n",
            "2. Complete an electronic complaint form and upload required documents at: https://my.ok.gov/Forms/Report%20Unemployment%20Fraud\n",

            "Under the rules of the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”), GOYAL and the ophthalmology practice he owned (the “Practice”) were ineligible for PPP relief due to GOYAL’s pending criminal charges.  In April 2020, in order to gain access to PPP funding, GOYAL falsely represented on two separate applications to the SBA and a financial institution headquartered in New York, New York (“Bank-1”), that he was not subject to any pending indictment.  The PPP also limited each business to one loan, with a maximum loan amount, and required applicants to certify that they have not and will not receive another PPP loan until December 31, 2020.  While making that certification, GOYAL circumvented the single-loan requirement by submitting two separate applications, with different business names, email addresses, business identification numbers, and loan amounts, for the same underlying Practice, while disclaiming on each application that he owned any other business.  Due to these misrepresentations, GOYAL successfully obtained two PPP loans totaling over $630,000.  GOYAL will be arraigned on June 26 in White Plains federal court before U.S. District Judge Cathy Seibel.\n",
            "Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said:  “While already facing charges for allegedly defrauding patients and insurers of millions of dollars, GOYAL allegedly used his practice to commit a new fraud in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.  As alleged, Goyal blatantly lied on multiple loan applications that he was not subject to any indictment, and on top of that, fraudulently double-dipped into the limited assets of the Paycheck Protection Program by pretending to apply on behalf of two separate businesses.  In so doing, Goyal allegedly looted over $630,000 in federal funds earmarked for legitimate small businesses in dire financial straits.”\n",
            "According to the allegations contained in the Superseding Indictment[1] filed today in White Plains federal court:\n",
            "During the relevant time period, GOYAL owned and operated Ameet Goyal, M.D. P.C., an ophthalmology practice doing business as Eye Associates Group, Rye Eye Associates, and other business names.  On November 21, 2019, an indictment (the “Indictment”) was returned in the action United States of America v. Ameet Goyal, 19 Cr. 844 (CS) (S.D.N.Y.), charging GOYAL with healthcare fraud, wire fraud, and making false statements relating to healthcare matters.  On November 22, 2019, GOYAL was arraigned on the Indictment and placed on pretrial release pursuant to an order that notified GOYAL of the potential effect of committing a criminal offense while on pretrial release.\n",

            "Applicants with pending criminal charges are ineligible for PPP loans.  One question on the PPP borrower application form (the “Pending Charges Question”) requires the applicant to answer “Yes” or “No” and put their initial next to the response to the following question:  “Is the Applicant (if an individual) or any individual owning 20% or more of the equity of the Applicant subject to an indictment, criminal information, arraignment, or other means by which formal criminal charges are brought in any jurisdiction, or presently incarcerated, or on probation or parole?”  The application expressly advises that if the Pending Charges Question is answered “Yes,” then “the loan will not be approved.”\n",
            "The PPP also limits each eligible borrower to one loan, and a maximum loan amount calculated based on a business’s average monthly payroll expenses.  The PPP application requires the applicant to certify and initial the representation that “During the period beginning on February 15, 2020 and ending on December 31, 2020, the Applicant has not and will not receive another loan under the Paycheck Protection Program.”\n",
            "In or about April 2020, GOYAL applied to the SBA and Bank-1, a federally insured institution, for over $630,000 in Government-guaranteed loans through the SBA’s PPP.  Specifically, on or about April 21, 2020, GOYAL applied for a loan (“Loan-1”) in the amount of $358,700 for the business “Ameet Goyal,” doing business as “Eye associates.”  GOYAL represented the applicant as a C-corporation with a business address in Rye, New York (“Business Address-1”), and supplied his own social security number as the applicant’s business identification number. \n",
            "On or about April 29, 2020, GOYAL applied for a second loan (“Loan-2”) from Bank-1 under the PPP, this time in the amount of $278,500.  On this application, GOYAL listed the applicant’s name as “Rye eye associates,” a sole proprietorship also located at Business Address-1.   For the applicant’s business identification number, GOYAL reported the Employer Identification Number for Ameet Goyal, M.D. P.C.  To substantiate each loan, however, GOYAL submitted the exact same underlying payroll expense report, showing the same employees and payroll costs. \n",
            "On each application, GOYAL stated that he was the president and 100% owner of the respective applicant, and that he did not own any business other than the listed applicant.  On both applications, GOYAL falsely answered “No” to the Pending Charges Question, and electronically placed his initials “AG” directly under his “No” response.  GOYAL also falsely certified, among other things, that the applicant will not receive another PPP loan until the end of the year.  \n",
            "After processing each of GOYAL’s signed and certified applications, which used different business names, business identification numbers, email addresses, and loan amounts, Bank-1 advised GOYAL that the respective application was approved by the SBA, and that the applicant would need to execute a loan note in order for the loan to be funded.  Bank-1’s signing instructions to each loan note advised, “REMINDER: The Small Business Administration, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, has determined that no eligible borrower may receive more than one PPP loan. A one loan per borrower limitation is necessary to help ensure that as many eligible borrowers as possible obtain PPP loans. If you have already received a PPP loan, you may not execute a loan note for another.” \n",
            "On or about May 3, 2020, GOYAL executed the Loan-1 loan note for $358,700, and received the funds in full on or about May 4, 2020.   On or about May 2 and 4, 2020, GOYAL executed multiple identical versions of the loan note for Loan-2 for $278,500, and received those funds in full on or about May 11, 2020.                        \n",

            "Nadine Consuelo Jackson, 31, was charged federally with bank fraud and making a false statement to a bank within the jurisdiction of a federal agency related to financial assistance for businesses who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States has seized more than $1.2 million dollars related to this alleged fraud.\n",

            "It is alleged Consuelo Jackson fraudulently sought forgivable loans in the amount of  $1.3 million and $1.2 million from the Small Business Administration by claiming to have 73 employees earning wages at a Dayton-based private investigation and security services business, Extract LLC.  In actuality, the charges allege there were few to no other employees working at Extract LLC.

One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through a program referred to as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). In April 2020, Congress authorized more than $300 billion in additional PPP funding.\n",

The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be entirely forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time and uses a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.  The amount of PPP funds a business may receive is determined by multiplying its average monthly payroll costs incurred during a specified period.\n",

A seizure warrant was obtained to seize that money as well.\n",

            " is part of Attorney General William P. Barr’s April 27, 2020 initiative directing Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division, and the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, Matthew Schneider, to review state and local policies to ensure that civil liberties are protected during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The United States Constitution requires government to protect the privileges and immunities of all citizens in our nation,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division. “These privileges and immunities include the right of Americans to travel freely anywhere in our country, and state governments cannot limit the right of out-of-state Americans to travel to their state unless doing so is substantially related to protecting the public safety. The Department of Justice remains committed to defending the constitutional rights of all Americans no matter where they live. The department will continue to be especially vigilant of any infringement on the right to travel that unduly harms the ability of Americans to earn a living and support their families.”\n",
            "“Reasonable measures designed to protect the public are not only appropriate, but responsible during a pandemic, and the Constitution does not bind the hands of state officials who, through careful thought and deliberation impose such measures. However, there are bounds to the discretion our public officials have during times of crisis. Those bounds are shaped by constitutional safeguards, such as the right of Hawaii residents and persons who hail from other states to travel freely within this great country. As our state leaders consider the way forward with Hawaii’s 14-day quarantine, it is my hope that they will pay due consideration to the protections embedded in the Constitution, so that visitors from far and wide may experience the Aloha spirit that makes Hawaii such a special place,” said Kenji M. Price, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Hawaii.\n",
            "Starting on March 4, 2020, the Governor of Hawaii has issued a series of Proclamations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest one, his Ninth Supplementary Proclamation, maintains a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine for anyone entering Hawaii. Those subject to this self-quarantine mandate must confine themselves at a single “designated quarantine location” within Hawaii and not leave there for two weeks (unless they are departing from the State). Anyone who violates the self-quarantine mandate faces up to a year in jail and a $5,000 fine. Those in Hawaii “not subject to the traveler self-quarantine,” by contrast, are free to travel throughout the State—including between islands—for a variety of purposes.\n",
            "In addition to contributing to the harm suffered by Hawaii’s tourism industry, the self-quarantine mandate precludes out-of-state residents who own properties in Hawaii from taking advantage of opportunities available to Hawaii residents who have not left the island since the onset of the pandemic.\n",
            "In its statement of interest, the United States explains that Hawaii’s self-quarantine requirement effectively discriminates against out-of-state residents. This effective discrimination, based on the evidence and argument presented thus far, appears to be inadequately tailored to further public safety and therefore does not comply with the Constitution. The statement of interest explains that it appears that a close analogue to Hawaii—Alaska—is able to protect public health through less restrictive means. Alaska, like Hawaii, has low number of COVID-19 cases. Alaska, like Hawaii, is typically reached by airplane. Alaska, like Hawaii, imposes a 14-day self-quarantine mandate on those entering the State. But Alaska, unlike Hawaii, provides out-of-state residents with alternatives to the self-quarantine: (i) they may produce test results showing they tested negative for COVID-19 shortly before departing for Alaska, (ii) they may test for COVID 19 upon arrival in Alaska and self-quarantine in Alaska until they receive a negative test result, or (iii) they may provide evidence that they have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past and have recovered. Although Hawaii’s Governor may take reasonable steps to protect public safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Governor must show that the effective discrimination against out-of-staters at issue here bears a substantial relationship to that goal. As of now, he has not done so.\n",

            "“Following action by the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, Mayor de Blasio provided much‑needed relief for New Yorkers by moving New York City to Phase 2 of its reopening plan.  Under Phase 2, in addition to the opening of various secular establishments, including outdoor dining and in‑store retail, houses of worship can reopen to 25% of their indoor capacity.\n",
            "Mayor de Blasio’s recent public statements and enforcement of COVID-19 Orders have demonstrated a troubling preference for certain First Amendment rights over others.  The Justice Department is glad Mayor de Blasio will now permit greater religious exercise and will continue to monitor New York City’s reopening to ensure that New York City extends the same respect to the freedom of religion, both in terms of indoor and outdoor gatherings, as it does to the freedoms of speech and assembly.”\n",
            "Background\n",
            "Last week, the Justice Department wrote Mayor de Blasio to express the concern that New York City was permitting large gatherings for political protest while not permitting in-person religious gatherings when the Constitution’s First Amendment protects both free speech rights and religious exercise.\n",
            "New York City had vigorously enforced restrictions on religious gatherings, including by sending police officers to disperse numerous gatherings of the Jewish community, including outdoor funerals.  At the same time, Mayor de Blasio marched in large in-person political gatherings concerning the recent tragic death of George Floyd and made statements suggesting — in a manner forbidden by the First Amendment — that religious exercise was less valued and protected by New York City than political exercise.\n",

            "In Austin today, federal authorities arrested Michael George McQuarn, 51 of Austin, for allegedly defrauding the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program of more than $2 million.\n",

Bash; SBA Office of Inspector General (SBA OIG) Central Region Special Agent in Charge Donald Abram; Acting IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Special Agent in Charge Rodrick Benton, Houston Field Office; Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration Office of Investigations (TIGTA) Special Agent in Charge Gary L. Smith, Mid-States Field Division; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) Special Agent in Charge Laurie L. Younger, Dallas; and, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton made today’s announcement.\n",
            "This year, Congress has authorized over $600 billion in emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans suffering economic hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  A portion of those funds included forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses (payroll, rent, utilities, mortgage payments, etc.) through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).  In order to receive funding, businesses must submit an application along with supporting documentation which must be approved by the SBA.\n",
            "A criminal complaint unsealed this morning charges McQuarn with wire fraud and making false statements to the SBA.  The complaint alleges that beginning in April 2020, McQuarn implemented a scheme whereby he submitted fraudulent applications and supporting paperwork of two fictitious companies he created—Vantastic Voyages, LLC and Happy Days Movers, LLC—to secure SBA-backed PPP loans.  McQuarn claimed the funds were for legitimate business purposes when, in fact, the money was used for his own personal use, including purchasing a 26’ Pavati Wake Boat and a Rolls Royce.  The complaint further alleges that McQuarn fraudulently received in excess of $2 million in PPP funds.   \n",
            "“The Paycheck Protection Program was designed to help Americans struggling with financial hardship during the pandemic. Our office will be aggressive in targeting anyone who defrauds this critical program,” stated U.S. Attorney Bash. \n",
            "“The defendant egregiously sought personal gain from a program intended to assist hardworking Americans in this challenging time,” said SBA OIG Central Region Special Agent in Charge Abram.  “SBA OIG and its law enforcement partners will aggressively pursue allegations of wrongdoing to maintain the integrity of SBA’s programs.  I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”\n",
            "“We are pleased to join our law enforcement partners in pursuit of those individuals using the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to defraud the nation’s financial institutions and government relief programs,” stated FDIC-OIG Special Agent in Charge Younger.\n",
            "Upon conviction, McQuarn faces terms of imprisonment up to 20 years for wire fraud and up to five years for making false statements to the SBA. \n",
            "SBA OIG, IRS-CI, FDIC-OIG, TIGTA and the Texas Attorney General’s Office are conducting this ongoing investigation.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matthew Devlin, Michael Galdo and Robert Almonte are prosecuting this case on behalf of the government.\n",

            "NEWARK, N.J. – A Chinese manufacturer was charged today with producing and exporting to the United States in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic over 140,000 misbranded and defective masks that falsely purported to be KN95 respirators, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito announced.\n",
            "Crawford Technology Group (HK) Co. LTD. (Crawford) is charged by complaint with violating the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) for causing misbranded and substandard respirators that falsely purported to meet various filtration efficiency standards to be imported into the United States.\n",
            "“Defective and misbranded personal protection equipment is a danger to all who unwittingly purchase and use it,” U.S. Attorney Carpenito said. “The Department of Justice and our partners remain committed to finding the unscrupulous companies that sell dangerous gear and stopping them from further endangering health care workers and first responders.”\n",
            "“It is not enough that this pandemic has upended lives around the world and caused countless suffering and hundreds of thousands of deaths,” Jason Molina, Special Agent in Charge, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Newark, said. “In the midst of that, we have companies like this that exploited this tragedy for financial gain and in the process put millions of lives at risk. This case is a good reminder that the combined efforts of the agencies involved in Attorney General Barr’s Task Force have a very long reach to track and charge those who commit such wrongdoing. In addition, for HSI this fulfills the mission of Operation Stolen Promise to rout out COVID related fraud in all its many forms.”\n",
            "Attorney General William P. Barr created the COVID-19 Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force, led by U.S. Attorney Carpenito, who is coordinating efforts with the Antitrust Division and U.S. Attorneys across the country wherever illegal activity involving protective personal equipment occurs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has issued a notice designating categories of health and medical supplies that must not be hoarded or sold for exorbitant prices.\n",
            "“In a time when the United States Postal Service is playing such a critical role in the nation’s supply chain, the United States Postal Inspectors will be ever vigilant in our pursuit of criminals using the mail to commit fraud schemes,” U.S. Postal Inspection Service Inspector in Charge James Buthorn said. “We will not stand by and allow American citizens to be preyed upon and are proud to stand with our partners defending the public as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Congratulation to the inspectors, special agents, and prosecutors.”\n",
            "“U.S. Customs and Border Protection is proud of the expertise we bring to support and assist investigations that result in the seizure of illicit products,” Troy Miller, Director New York Field Office, said. “It is through interagency partnerships and collaborative efforts, like the one leading to today’s criminal charges, that law enforcement successfully combats today’s criminal organizations.”\n",
            "“The FDA is actively monitoring the marketplace for fraudulent products related to our battle against COVID-19 that are marketed and distributed to Americans. The agency will continue to collaborate with our fellow law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who place profits above the public health during this pandemic,” Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey J. Ebersole, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations New York Field Office, said. “We will take appropriate action against those who jeopardize the health of Americans and take advantage of a crisis.”\n",
            "According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:\n",
            "In May 2020, Crawford, a digital electronics company based in Shenzhen, China, manufactured and sold 140,400 adulterated and misbranded KN95 filtering face piece respirators to Company-1 for import into the United States.\n",
            "The packaging for the respirators, as well as the respirators themselves, falsely indicated that they were 95 percent efficient at filtering harmful airborne particles. The respirators and their packaging also claimed that they complied with established standards in the European Union and China, which require at least 94 percent or 95 percent filtering efficiency, respectively. Crawford also advertised the respirators on its website under a tab labeled “epidemic” and claimed that their respirators have “4 layers of protection” and “Passed the national standard 2626-2000 test.”  The page also says “KN95 Filtration reaches 95%,” “KN95 Filter Effect 95%,” and states that their respirators protect against “Severe Haze,” “Bacteria,” and “Dust.” These claims were false and misleading because the average filtering efficiency for the Crawford respirators was 22.33 percent, far below the required thresholds.   \n",
            "U.S. Attorney Carpenito thanked the staff of the NIOSH National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, under the direction of NIOSH Director John Howard M.D., and special agents of the U.S. Secret Service for their work on the investigation.\n",

Moran.  GENE WAMSLEY was employed as a Respiratory Therapist at VAMC until he was placed on leave from VAMC on June 9, 2020.  WAMSLEY made his initial appearance on the criminal complaint today in Seattle.\n",
            "“Right now respiratory support equipment is critical in medical care for those suffering with COVID-19 infections.  To steal and sell equipment needed to care for our veterans is a shocking betrayal,” said U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran. \n",
            "According to the criminal complaint, the investigation began in January 2020 when VAMC reported two bronchoscopes missing from the hospital.  A third bronchoscope was reported missing in April 2020.  Staff at the VAMC had noticed bronchoscopes listed for sale on eBay from a seller in Bonney Lake, Washington.  The investigation linked the sale of three bronchoscopes to WAMSLEY.  A further review of eBay records revealed WAMSLEY had sold five ventilators in March and April 2020.  Three ventilators were found to be missing from VMAC during the same time period.  EBay records reveal a variety of other respiratory support equipment sold by the account linked to WAMSLEY.  Administrators at VAMC confirmed the items were used in the respiratory therapy department.\n",
            "Law enforcement executed a court authorized search warrant at WAMSLEY’s home on June 9, 2020.  Medical supplies and eBay sales records were seized in the search.\n",

            "United States Attorney for the Virgin Islands, Gretchen C.F. Shappert, announced that earlier this week, the United States Department of Justice launched its new Civil Rights Reporting Portal. This new online tool will make it easier for the public to report civil rights violations.\n",
            "“The department is committed to upholding the civil and constitutional rights of all people in the United States,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division. “The Civil Rights Reporting Portal will make it easier for the public to connect with us, which in turn makes us more effective at upholding these important rights. I encourage the public to use this portal to report civil rights violations.”\n",
            "The Civil Rights Reporting Portal – located at civilrights.justice.gov – consolidates over 30 unique reporting pathways. The portal dramatically eases the burden on victims of civil rights violations to identify the proper reporting channel. The form is fully accessible to people with disabilities. It is also available in both English and Spanish, with more languages to be added over the next year. Members of the public will find it easier to tell their story, submit their report, and receive guidance on what to expect next. The new form is designed to help the Civil Rights Division receive information needed to process reports efficiently. Based upon users’ answers, the form routes reports to the most appropriate team in the Civil Rights Division. The teams will read and review every report, in order to determine how best to proceed.\n",
            "Individuals who believe they may have been a victim of a civil rights violation can learn how to report violations to the Department by visiting civilrights.justice.gov. When appropriate, the Civil Rights Division staff will refer complainants to other agencies that are responsible for handling specific types of complaints.\n",
            "According to U.S. Attorney Shappert, “The Civil Rights Reporting Portal is a user-friendly reporting platform that will enable federal prosecutors and agents to identify and respond to alleged civil rights violations. The range of federal civil rights protections is very broad and includes voting, housing and land use, lending and credit, public accommodations, education,\n",
            "employment, policing, prisons and jails, disability rights, service-member rights and more. The Portal helps the Department to more easily hear from and respond to victims of civil rights violations from across the country”. Shappert noted that the Department’s Civil Rights Division receives approximately 100,000 contacts from the public each year regarding potential civil rights violations. “The need for more effective reporting opportunities is great, which is why Department personnel worked for over a year to design a more streamlined reporting process,” she said.\n",
            "Shappert also emphasized that individuals who believe they are a victim of a criminal violation of their civil rights, such as misconduct by law enforcement officers, a hate crime, or human trafficking, should contact their local FBI office.\n",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic and public health emergency has impacted many vulnerable community members, including persons with disabilities, persons with limited English proficiency, service members, and other persons protected by our nation’s civil rights laws because of their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. COVID-19 has particularly impacted individuals in their ability to pay their rent, increasing housing insecurity. It is a violation of the Federal Fair Housing Act (FHA) for housing providers, including landlords, and managers, to exploit this crisis by sexually harassing tenants in exchange for rent or other housing needs.\n",
            "“Enforcing our nation’s civil rights laws is one of the top priorities in my office.” said Minkler. “We must remain vigilant and work together in this area, especially during this public health crisis. COVID-19 has affected all races, religions, ethnicities, and those with disabilities. Please help us address any suspect discrimination, as we enforce the laws that prohibit such behavior.”\n",
            "The Department of Justice has filed lawsuits across the country where a pattern or practice of sexual harassment in housing is alleged. Investigations frequently uncover sexual harassment that has been ongoing for years. Many individuals do not know that being sexually harassed by a housing provider can violate federal law or that the Department of Justice may be able to help.\n",

            "WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Attorney Christina Nolan joined Attorney General William P. Barr and the entire Department of Justice in observing the 15th Annual World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. The Department echoes voices around the world condemning elder abuse, neglect and exploitation.\n",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for our country and the world, but among those most severely affected by the threat of the novel virus are our senior citizens. During this time when seniors are most vulnerable and isolated from their families and loved ones by social distancing and quarantine restrictions, bad actors have immediately exploited this international tragedy to prey on the elderly through a whole host of scam and fraud schemes perpetrated via phone, mail, and internet. As the world takes this day to remember the elderly during these uncertain times, the Department of Justice remains relentlessly committed, through its department-wide Elder Justice Initiative, to prevent and prosecute fraud on America’s seniors.\n",
            "The Department will aggressively prosecute fraudsters exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic and targeting seniors offering them fake testing kits, fake treatments and cures, and fake help obtaining stimulus and Paycheck Protection Program Funds.  On this day dedicated to recognizing our seniors, the Department of Justice sends a strong message that we continue the fight to keep seniors safe a top priority.\n",
            "“Society should be measured by how well it protects its most vulnerable members, including our seniors which make up roughly 20% of Vermont’s population,” stated U.S Attorney Nolan. “Protection of the elderly is a deeply rooted American and Vermont ideal.  My office will continue to devote special focus and investigative and prosecutorial resources to this goal.  We will be ever vigilant during the pandemic, when bad actors use isolation and distancing to prey on the elderly.  We aim to prevent this treacherous conduct before it occurs by raising awareness, and, to be clear, a bad actor who successfully exploits the COVID crisis to harm a Vermont senior (or attempts to do so), will be the subject of aggressive prosecution by my office, working with state and local partners.”  \n",
            "Earlier this year Attorney General Barr declared “Prevention and Disruption of Transnational Elder Fraud” to be an Agency Priority Goal, making it one of the Department’s four top priorities.  The Vermont U.S. Attorney’s Office has brought federal charges in significant elder fraud cases in recent years, including prosecutions of three Canadian individuals who defrauded four elderly Americans of hundreds of thousands of dollars.  In addition, the Vermont U.S. Attorney’s Office has engaged in significant community outreach focused on combatting elder fraud.  For instance, last year, U.S. Attorney Nolan gave the keynote address at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Elder Financial Protection and Response Network Convening in Burlington, Vermont.  The Convening, which the Vermont U.S. Attorney’s Office helped organize, brought together Vermont stakeholders, public and private, committed to protecting the elderly from financial fraud.  The Vermont U.S. Attorney’s Office also has provided training and guidance on the Department’s Elder Justice Initiative, including through meetings of the Financial Abuse Specialist Team of Vermont (FAST) as well as through FAST’s Tri-State Conference in October 2019.\n",
            "Major strides have already been made toward the Department’s goal to combat elder abuse: \n",

            "\tEarlier this year Attorney General Barr launched a National Elder Fraud Hotline. Staffed by experienced case managers who provide personalized support to callers, the hotline serves to assist elders and caretakers who believe they have been a victim of fraud by reporting that fraud and providing appropriate services.\n",

            "Transnational Elder Fraud Strike Force: Established in June 2019 to combat foreign elder fraud schemes, the Strike Force is composed of the Department’s Consumer Protection Branch and six U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along with FBI special agents, Postal Inspectors, and numerous other law enforcement personnel.  Since its inception, prosecutors in Strike Force districts brought cases against more than 140 defendants.\n",
            "\t \n",
            "Annual Elder Justice Sweep: In March of this year, the Attorney General announced the largest coordinated sweep of elder fraud cases in department history. The Department, together with every U.S. Attorney’s office, charged more than 400 defendants responsible for over $1 billion in loss through fraud schemes that largely affected seniors.\n",
            "\t \n",
            "Money Mule Initiative: Since October 2018, the Department and its law enforcement partners began a concentrated effort across the country and around the world to disrupt, investigate, and prosecute money mule activity used to facilitate fraud schemes, especially those victimizing senior citizens. A “money mule” is someone who transfers illegally acquired money on behalf of or at the direction of another. Money mules may assist fraud schemes by receiving money from victims, many of them elderly, and forwarding the proceeds to foreign-based perpetrators. In 2019 actions were taken to halt the conduct of more than 600 domestic money mules, exceeding a similar effort against approximately 400 mules in the previous year. The Vermont U.S. Attorney’s Office is an active participant in the Money Mule Initiative, coordinating with the FBI to disrupt this activity. \n",

            "According to the criminal complaint, Iyalekhue and Osawaru participated in a series of romance, pandemic unemployment insurance, and other online scams designed to defraud victims by convincing them to send money to accounts controlled by the defendants. To carry out the scams, the defendants allegedly used false foreign passports in the names of others, but with their photos, to open numerous bank accounts, and in turn directed the victims to send money to these accounts. Iyalekhue and Osawaru then rapidly withdrew the victims’ money from various bank branches and ATMs, often multiple times during a single day. It is alleged that the schemes included collecting unemployment insurance in the name of others during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            "The charging statute provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater, and forfeiture.

            "         Keith Lawrence Middlebrook, 52, was named in an indictment that charges him with 11 counts of wire fraud stemming from solicitations he allegedly made to potential investors in Nevada, New York, Texas and Colorado.\n",
            "         “Through text messages, videos, and statements sent to potential investors and posted on the internet, including on Instagram and YouTube, defendant Middlebrook falsely claimed to have developed a cure for the COVID-19 virus, which he called ‘QC20,’ and a treatment that prevented a person from being infected by the COVID-19 virus, which he called ‘QP20,’” according to the indictment.\n",
            "         The FBI arrested Middlebrook in this case on March 25 after Middlebrook delivered pills – purportedly the treatment that prevents coronavirus infection – to an undercover agent who was posing as an investor. Two of the charges in the indictment relate to communications with the undercover agent.\n",
            "         The indictment alleges that Middlebrook claimed to have personally developed a “patent-pending” cure and a treatment to prevent coronavirus infection, even though “[g]overnmental and non-governmental health organizations both within the United States and abroad confirmed that there was no vaccine or specific antiviral medicine then known to prevent or treat COVID-19,” according to the indictment.\n",

(also known as QC20) with a series of false promises. Those fraudulent claims included miraculous results from the prevention product and the cure, risk-free and 100 percent guaranteed “enormous returns” on investments,” and that Earvin “Magic” Johnson was a director and/or officer of QC20, the indictment alleges.\n",
            "         “To bolster these claims, defendant Middlebrook falsely represented that an unnamed party in Dubai had offered to purchase the companies for $10 billion, and this offer would secure the victim-investors’ investments in QP20 and/or QC20; and that he had secured funding from seven investors who had each already invested between $750,000 and $1,000,000,” the indictment alleges.\n",

            "Seattle—The U.S. Attorney’s Office Western District of Washington and the U.S. Department Justice today filed a statement of interest in Roque v. Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) as part of DOJ’s work to safeguard the civil rights of all Americans, announced  U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran.  The suit arises out of the efforts of a resident of Raven Terrace in the Yesler Terrace area of Seattle to obtain parking garage access for his caregiver.  The plaintiff, Tony Roque, has quadriplegia and requires caregiver assistance for his daily activities.  Mr. Roque filed suit against the Seattle Housing Authority after it refused his request to modify its policies and allow his caregiver parking access in the building’s garage.\n",
            "“With this filing DOJ is making clear what we believe to be the state of the law – the Fair Housing Act requires modifications to housing complex policies when modifications are necessary to afford a resident with a disability with equal access to the enjoyment of his or her home.  That is true even when the accommodation relates to caregiver access, ” said U.S. Attorney Moran.  “Safeguarding the rights of people with disabilities is even more important during this period of COVID-19, when the isolation and risks facing many people with disabilities are heightened.”\n",
            "According to records filed in the case and the government’s statement of interest, Mr. Roque alleges that he needs caregiver assistance for the necessities of daily life – eating, dressing, administering medication, etc.  Due to covid-19, the number of caregivers accessing his apartment has been reduced to one.  That caregiver had been parking in the garage of Raven Terrace from 2018 until early March 2020 so that she could deliver Mr. Roque’s groceries and medical supplies and transport him to medical appointments, etc.  On March 4, 2020, the Housing Authority had the caregiver’s car towed saying that since she was not a resident nor an employee she was not allowed to park in the building.  When Mr. Roque requested a parking pass for the caregiver, his request was denied.  The Seattle Housing Authority claimed that since the caregiver is not disabled, and the parking space was for the caregiver, it is not required to grant the accommodation.\n",
            "In its statement of interest, DOJ states that under the FHA, a parking space for a caregiver of a resident with a disability may be a “necessary” accommodation under certain circumstances. Further under the ADA, a reasonable accommodation may not be denied solely because it would provide Mr. Roque with a benefit not available to other residents.\n",
            "U.S. District Judge Richard A. Jones issued a temporary restraining order on May 4, 2020, prohibiting the Seattle Housing Authority from towing the caregiver’s car.  Judge Jones can make the order permanent, depending on the decision made by the Seattle Housing Authority on Mr. Roque’s appeal.  \n",
            "The statement of interest was filed by Assistant United States Attorney Christina Fogg, the Civil Rights Coordinator in the Western District of Washington, and by Trial Attorney Max Lapertosa of the DOJ Civil Rights Division. \n",

The letter urges county Executive Elrich and the County Council to ensure that the county’s executive orders and enforcement of them respect both the right of residents to assemble and practice their faith.\n",
            "The letter applauds Montgomery County for allowing gatherings for political protest, but urges the county to allow gatherings for religious exercise on equal terms. The letter specifically references Montgomery County’s Executive Order No. 070-20, which banned all gatherings larger than 10 persons, County Executive Elrich’s June 1, 2020 statement supporting freedom of assembly and public safety, which nevertheless committed the County to providing a protected environment for peaceful protests. The letter notes that the executive order would have prohibited the protest held in Bethesda, Maryland, on June 2 that reportedly involved hundreds of people packed into a library and urged the County to amend its order to protect its residents’ First Amendment rights. In doing so, the letter cautioned that the County should treat religious gatherings no less favorably than similar secular gatherings. \n",
            "“During a crisis it is important for people of faith to be able to exercise their religion,” said Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Eric Dreiband. “Montgomery County has shown no good reason for not trusting congregants who promise to use care in worship the same way it trusts political protesters to do the same. The Department of Justice will continue to take action if states and localities infringe on the free exercise of religion or other civil liberties.”\n",

            "WASHINGTON - The Department of Justice today filed a statement of interest in a Washington State federal court supporting the First Amendment religious freedom claims of a Pierce County church, explaining how a recent Supreme Court decision, South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom (May 29, 2020), supports the church’s claim. \n",
            "The statement of interest explains that Washington’s preferable treatment of secular gatherings such as restaurants, taverns, and outdoor protests compared to the restrictions imposed on indoor and outdoor religious services triggers heightened scrutiny under the Constitution.\n",
            "The statement of interest is part of Attorney General William P. Barr's April 27, 2020 initiative directing Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Eric Dreiband, and the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, Matthew Schneider, to review state and local policies to ensure that civil liberties are protected during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",
            "“The protections enshrined in the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights are enduring, and we must be vigilant in making sure that governments do not unlawfully infringe upon the rights that they protect. First among these rights is the First Amendment’s guarantee that no government in this country may prohibit the free exercise of religion,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division. “The Constitution’s protections are especially critical during times of crisis. The United States must remain committed at all times to the right of all people to worship and pray and follow the dictates of their conscience in a manner that respects others and the public health and safety. By doing so, our nation honors the legacy of countless patriots who worked, struggled, fought, suffered, and died to protect our freedom. The Department of Justice will continue its efforts to secure the Constitutional rights of all people in this nation.”\n",
            "“The department will continue to be vigilant in protecting religious liberty when states and localities exceed constitutional limits,” said Matthew Schneider, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, who, with Assistant Attorney General Dreiband, is overseeing the Justice Department’s effort to monitor state and local polices relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            "“At a time of uncertainty and anguish in our community, the ability to gather to express one’s faith and seek comfort is a fundamental right,” said U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran for the Western District of Washington. “Just as we have seen peaceful protestors gathered together and exercising their First Amendment rights, so too must we protect the right of religious institutions such as churches, mosques and temples to gather together and express their faith.”\n",
            "Two weeks ago, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling regarding California’s reopening plan in South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom (May 29, 2020).  By a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court declined to temporarily block California’s rules. In their opinions explaining the result, however, each Justice who wrote agreed that even during the COVID-19 pandemic the Constitution requires states to treat houses of worship equally with comparable secular businesses. Chief Justice Roberts concluded that, on the facts of the California case, California “exempts or treats more leniently only dissimilar activities, such as operating grocery stores, banks, and laundromats, in which people neither congregate in large groups nor remain in close proximity for extended periods.”  He also noted that the “precise question of when restrictions on particular social activities should be lifted during the pandemic is dynamic and fact-intensive matter subject to reasonable disagreement,” which, when within constitutional bounds is entrusted to the “politically accountable officials of the states.” Justices Kavanaugh, Thomas and Gorsuch would have “grant[ed] the Church’s requested [relief] because California’s latest safety guidelines discriminate against places of worship and in favor of comparable secular businesses.” \n",
            "In its statement of interest filed today in Haborview Fellowship v. Inslee, the United States explains that the State of Washington “exempts or treats more leniently” precisely the types of activities that Chief Justice Roberts said are appropriate comparators for religious gatherings—specifically, activities that involve people “congregat[ing] in large groups [ ]or remain[ing] in close proximity for extended period,” such as restaurants, taverns, and protests. Because those activities are permitted with social distancing and hygiene measures, the church must be treated the same unless the state can persuasively show that there are material differences between gathering for an extended period in a restaurant or tavern and a house of worship, or between an outdoor protest and an outdoor worship service.\n",
            "Washington currently permits various restaurants and taverns to operate at 50% of capacity with no total cap on number of patrons, so long as they observe 6-foot social distancing and various hygiene measures.  Places of worship, however, are limited to a hard cap of 50 people or 25% of capacity, whichever is less. Outdoor worship services are limited to 100 people. As detailed in the statement of interest, Governor Inslee has placed no limit on total numbers for outdoor protests, only requesting that participants  “be safe for themselves and the people around them” by “wearing a mask and . . . distancing as much as you can.”\n",

            "Date: 6/09/2020\n",

            "Press Release:\n",
            "The Department of Justice today filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in support of a lawsuit by plaintiffs Ron Givens and Christine Bish, two individuals seeking to hold peaceful in-person protests of 500 to 1,000 people with social distancing on the grounds of the California State Capitol Building.\n",
            "In its friend-of-the-court brief in the Ninth Circuit, the United States explains that the district court wrongly denied plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief against California’s total ban on peaceful protests.  While States have broad authority to protect the public during the COVID-19 pandemic, the First Amendment does not give them carte blanche to ban peaceful public protests and rallies.  The brief also explains that the real and legitimate national outcry over George Floyd’s tragic killing has shown the importance of peaceful public protests to maintaining our civic fabric—and has highlighted the extreme nature of a blanket protest ban in California.  Going forward, it could raise First Amendment concerns if California were to hold other protests, such as those proposed by the plaintiffs in this lawsuit, to a different standard.\n",
            "“Political speech in traditional public gathering spaces is at the core of the First Amendment’s protection of speech and assembly,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division.  “Moments of national trial reinforce the importance of the right of the people peaceably to speak and assemble.  For more than two centuries, the First Amendment has endured, and it has helped preserve the United States of America as a beacon of hope and liberty for our people and for oppressed people all over the world.  The right to protest government peacefully is at the heart of who we are as a people.  Today’s filing by the Justice Department makes clear that the First Amendment right to freedom of speech and the rest of the Bill of Rights' protections remain in full force and effect at all times.”\n",
            "“Now more than ever, Americans are exercising their First Amendment right to peacefully protest, and this fundamental right must be upheld even during times of national emergency,” said Matthew Schneider, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, who, with Assistant Attorney General Dreiband, is overseeing the Justice Department’s effort to monitor state and local policies relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            "The friend-of-the-court brief is part of Attorney General William P. Barr’s April 27, 2020 initiative directing Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, Matthew Schneider, to review state and local policies to ensure that civil liberties are protected during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",
            "Givens is a firearms instructor and the director of training at the Sacramento Gun Club.  He has been seeking to hold a protest on the California State Capitol Building grounds objecting to the State’s delay, purportedly due to the COVID-19 outbreak, in conducting background checks for gun purchasers.  Bish is a resident of Sacramento County and is a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in the November 2020 general election who also wishes to organize a protest relating to the State’s response to the outbreak on the California State Capitol grounds. \n",
            "On March 19, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order, which requires “all individuals living in the State of California to stay at home or at their place of residence except as needed to maintain continuity of operations” in various “critical infrastructure sectors.”  The executive order further requires Californians to “heed the State public health directives from the Department of Public Health.”  At the time plaintiffs filed their complaint, those directives banned “until further notice” all public gatherings of any size in any “indoor or outdoor” space, and applied to “all non-essential professional, social, and community gatherings regardless of their sponsor.”  Violations of the executive order are subject to criminal penalties.  Neither the executive order nor the directives in place when plaintiffs filed their complaint made any exceptions for First Amendment activities, such as peaceful protest.  Thus in California, all gatherings of any size protesting government action were banned.     \n",
            "Following the executive order, the California Highway Patrol denied Givens’ and Bish’s applications for a permit to protest, even though they planned to practice social distancing and to require protesters to wear masks.  In their lawsuit, plaintiffs argued that the grounds of the California State Capitol Building “are the most important and widely used public forum in California” and have been the site of “[c]ountless watershed protests.”  They claimed that California’s actions “amount[ed] to a total ban on public gatherings for the purpose of engaging in First Amendment [conduct] by means of demonstrations, rallies, or protests, regardless of the measures taken to reduce or eliminate the risk of the [COVID-19] virus spreading.” \n",
            "Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, which the district court denied on the ground that California’s “total ban on public demonstrations” is consistent with the First Amendment.  On May 17, 2020, plaintiffs appealed the district court’s order to the Ninth Circuit.\n",
            "Since the filing of plaintiffs’ appeal, California has announced new guidelines for political protest that, in relevant part, allow socially distant protests of a maximum of 100 attendees or 25% of the relevant area’s maximum occupancy, whichever is lower.  According to California, “[t]his limitation on attendance will be reviewed at least once every 21 days, beginning May 25, 2020,” to “assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of gatherings that implicate the First Amendment.”  Plaintiffs, who are seeking to hold protests of 500 to 1,000 attendees, are continuing to challenge California’s revised orders.\n",
            "The federal case on appeal is Givens, et al. v. Newsom, et al., No. 20-15949 (9th Cir.).\n",

            "Press Release:\n",
            "Remarks as Prepared for Delivery\n",
            "Good morning Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein, and members of the Committee.\n",
            "Thank you for inviting us to appear before you today to discuss the Department of Justice’s (the Department) efforts to detect and prosecute those who seek to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic dislocation it has caused for personal financial gain. We have been tasked by the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General to lead the Department’s Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force (Mr. Carpenito) and to coordinate more generally the Department’s response to criminal conduct relating to the COVID-19 pandemic (Mr. Hughes). We want to thank the Committee for its attention to this issue and to the good work of the Department to protect the safety and security of our nation during this unprecedented crisis.\n",
            "The Department is committed to detecting, investigating, and prosecuting wrongdoing related to the crisis. The Department has received reports of, is investigating, and has already commenced prosecutions of individuals and businesses using the crisis to seek windfall profits at the expense of public safety and the health and welfare of the American people, from the sale of fake cures for COVID-19 online, hoarding and price gouging with respect to critical medical supplies, and defrauding the CARES Act economic programs.\n",
            "To be clear, the Department will not tolerate any bad actors who seek to treat the pandemic as an opportunity to defraud their fellow citizens or the government. In addition to the work of the task force charged with addressing hoarding and price gouging, the Department is also engaged in an effort to detect and counter fraud as well as price-fixing and other forms of market manipulation that constitute violations of antitrust law. The Department’s attorneys work side-by-side with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other investigative partners from a variety of federal, state, and local agencies.\n",
            "Prosecuting Hoarding and Price Gouging under the Defense Production Act\n",
            "Hoarding and price gouging, in particular, have the added effect of inhibiting frontline healthcare professionals, essential workers, and the public from acquiring the supplies they need to protect themselves from contracting the virus. The limited supplies of these crucial products, and associated reports of hoarding and price gouging, prompted the signing of an Executive Order by the President invoking authority under the Defense Production Act (DPA) and the subsequent formation of the anti-hoarding, anti-price gouging task force led by Mr. Carpenito.\n",
            "As you are undoubtedly aware, the DPA confers broad authority on the President to combat hoarding and price gouging.1 Under Section 101(a)(1) of the DPA, the President may require parties to accept and perform contracts deemed necessary to the national defense. Under Section 101(a)(2), the President may allocate materials, services, and facilities in such manner as deemed necessary or appropriate for the national defense. Under Section 102, the President may prohibit hoarding scarce materials in excess of the reasonable demands of business, personal or home consumption, or for the purpose of resale at prices in excess of the prevailing market price. The DPA also gives the President a range of administrative and civil enforcement tools to enforce compliance with the Act.\n",
            "Section 101(b) of the DPA provides the mechanism for how the President triggers his authority under section 101(a) of the DPA. Subsection (b) provides that the President must find that (1) the material at issue “is a scarce or critical material essential to the national defense,” and (2) “the requirements of the national defense for such material cannot otherwise be met without creating a significant dislocation of the normal distribution of such material in the civilian market\n",
            "to such a degree as to create appreciable hardship.”\n",
            "In Executive Order 13909, issued on March 18, 2020, the President made the findings prescribed by subsection (b), thereby triggering his Section 101(a) authority. Specifically, the President determined that the “health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19, including personal protective equipment and ventilators, meet the criteria specified in section 101(b)” of the DPA. Executive Order 13909 further confers on the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) the President’s authority under Section 101(a) “to require performance of contracts or orders (other than contracts of employment) to promote the national defense over performance of any other contracts or orders” and “to allocate materials, services, and facilities as deemed necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense,” with respect to “all health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19 within the United States.” The order also delegates to the Secretary of HHS the various implementation and enforcement authorities under Section 101 of the DPA with respect to health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19. This Executive Order thus authorizes the federal government to require the sale of needed resources either to the government or to any other party it deems appropriate.\n",
            "In Executive Order 13910, issued on March 23, 2020 the President declared it the policy of the United States to prevent the hoarding of health and medical resources essential to combatting the spread of COVID-19. That order delegated to the Secretary of HHS the President’s authority under Section 102 to designate materials as scarce for the purpose of prohibiting the hoarding or price gouging with respect to such materials. In Executive Order 13911, issued on March 27, 2020, the President delegated the same authority to the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n",
            "On March 25, 2020, the Secretary of HHS published a notice in the Federal Register in which he designated fifteen categories of health and medical resources as scarce. That notice acknowledged that it is the policy of the U.S. that health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and sanitizing and disinfecting products, are appropriately distributed, and stated that that policy furthered the goal of protecting the Nation’s healthcare system from undue strain. The materials designated as scarce include respirator face masks like the N95 mask, ventilators, sterilization services, medical gowns, Tyvek® suits, face shields, surgical masks, and surgical gloves. This notice triggered the criminal prohibitions of Section 102 of the DPA. The designations are to be periodically reviewed by HHS and are set to expire after 120 days unless a superseding notice is published.\n",
            "To carry out prosecutions for violations of the criminal prohibitions under the DPA, the Attorney General announced to the Department the formation of a task force to combat hoarding and price gouging. The Attorney General appointed Mr. Carpenito to lead the task force. He further instructed each U.S. Attorney’s office and the relevant Department litigating components, particularly the Antitrust Division, to designate experienced attorneys to serve as members of and provide support to the task force.\n",
            "The task force’s primary mission is to identify, investigate, and prosecute instances of illegal hoarding of the critical medical supplies designated by HHS. Section 103 of the DPA criminalizes the conduct prohibited by Section 102. Every violation of Section 103 requires proof of two general elements: first, that the defendant actually did something expressly prohibited, or failed to do something expressly required, by either the DPA itself, or by any rule, regulation, or order issued under the DPA; and second, that the defendant did so willfully, meaning with knowledge that his conduct was generally unlawful. Section 103 imposes criminal penalties for willful violations of the DPA and of regulations and orders issued under the Act that include up to a $10,000 fine and imprisonment of no longer than one year for each offense.\n",
            "The violations of the DPA that this task force primarily investigates are violations of Section 102 of the DPA. A willful violation of Section 102 requires proof of at least three elements in addition to the elements set forth above: first, that the defendant accumulated materials; second, accumulation of at least some of the materials took place after the materials were designated in the Federal Register as scarce and important to the national defense; and third, that the defendant accumulated the materials either (a) in excess of his or her reasonable needs of business, personal, or home consumption; or (b) for the purpose of resale at prices in excess of prevailing market prices.\n",
            "Any charging decisions the Department makes under the DPA will take into account the larger context of the current public health crisis. The decisions the Department makes to open\n",
            "investigations or to bring charges are intended to help the public health response, not hinder it. This means that, as a practical matter, the task force is focused on profiteering. We recognize that many established manufacturers and distributors of PPE have not meaningfully increased their prices since the start of the pandemic. We understand this because some of their prices are publicly available. 3M, for example, has published a price list for the many different models of N95 masks it manufactures.3 According to 3M, most of their N95 respirators should cost an enduser less than $2.\n",
            "There are resellers out there, however, who are charging substantially higher prices than these traditional market participants. When the task force sees substantially higher prices, it inquires whether the legitimate costs of the reseller are high. If, in order to turn any profit or simply break even, the reseller must set a high resale price, even a price much higher than other transactions in the market, the fact that the reseller is not profiteering is important for us to consider. It is likewise important if the reseller’s costs are not particularly higher than the costs a traditional distributor incurs, but the reseller nevertheless demands a resale price substantially higher than the traditional price for the same goods. The purpose or effect of such a price is to allow that reseller to capture a profit margin that is substantially higher than what resellers generally earned prior to crisis, or are even generally earning now.\n",
            "The Department’s efforts have already yielded substantial results. On April 2, 2020, the Department announced the distribution of hoarded personal protective equipment (PPE), including hundreds of thousands of N95 respirator masks, to those on the frontline of the COVID-19 response in New York and New Jersey. The FBI discovered the supplies on March 30, 2020, during an investigation coordinated by the task force. The task force alerted HHS, which used its authority under the DPA to order that the supplies be sold to the U.S. In addition to the N95 respirator masks, the Department was seized a cache of hundreds of thousands of medical-grade-gloves, surgical masks, gowns, and other medical supplies. We understand that HHS was able to immediately collect that PPE and redistribute it to state and local authorities for further distribution to front line healthcare providers.\n",
            "Just two weeks ago, the Department announced hoarding and price gouging charges against a man in New Jersey who allegedly attempted to defraud New York City into paying him approximately $45 million for PPE masks at excessive prices that he did not possess and was not authorized to sell, and also brought similar charges against a licensed pharmacist in New York who allegedly sold N95 respirators to customers for up to 50% more than he paid to acquire them. These case both involved other criminal charges, including wire fraud and health care fraud.\n",
            "In addition to hoarding and price gouging, the task force also is focused on identifying counterfeit and misbranded PPE imported into the U.S. from abroad. The task force has been coordinating with the FDA and the Consumer Protection Branch of the Department’s Civil Division when such situations present themselves.\n",
            "Combatting Fraud and Abuse\n",
            "In addition to the work of the task force, U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and many Department components, including the Criminal Division and the Civil Division, are combatting fraud relating to COVID-19.\n",
            "On March 16, 2020, the Attorney General issued a memorandum directing every U.S. Attorney’s Office “to prioritize the detection, investigation, and prosecution of all criminal conduct related to the current pandemic.” Within days, each of the 94 U.S. Attorneys’ Offices identified and appointed one prosecutor to serve as the office’s Coronavirus Coordinator to ensure that those cases were given the highest priority.\n",
            "Assistant United States Attorneys across the nation are committed to the mission of combatting fraud relating to COVID-19, and they work with lawyers throughout the department to bring to bear all the criminal and civil tools necessary to investigate, prevent, and prosecute sales of fraudulent PPE and COVID-19 treatments, cures, and tests; the use of stolen identities to obtain health care, Economic Impact Payment, unemployment, or other government benefits; and loan fraud, bank fraud, money laundering, and aggravated identity theft relating to CARES Act funds. The U.S Attorneys’ Offices work with every major law enforcement agency to investigate and prosecute the fraud arising out of the pandemic; they often pair with the Criminal Division and the Civil Division to ensure that they are using every tool available to prevent and prosecute the fraud. They also have leveraged and have further strengthened relationships with State and local law enforcement counterparts in their districts, leading to more effective enforcement and more successful prosecutions.\n",
            "The Criminal Division Fraud Section, working closely with the FBI and the Small\n",
            "Business Administration (SBA), has been focusing meaningful investigative efforts on fraud relating to the CARES Act’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The PPP authorizes up to $659 billion in forgivable loans of up to $10 million each to small businesses, nonprofits, veterans organizations, and tribal business concerns to cover employee paychecks and certain non-payroll costs during the crisis. As of June 3, 2020, the Department’s prosecutors have already brought six cases charging fraud in connection with PPP loan applications:\n",

Fayne allegedly obtained a PPP loan over $2 million and then used over $1.5 million of the proceeds to purchase $85,000 in jewelry, including a Rolex Presidential watch, a diamond bracelet, and a 5.73 carat diamond ring, and to pay $40,000 for child support.\n",

            "\n",
            "Sadleir was charged with fraudulently filing bank loan applications for a film production company that sought more than $1.7 million dollars in forgivable PPP loans. Sadleir allegedly obtained the forgivable loans by falsely representing that the funds would be used to support payroll expenses, when, in fact, Sadleir intended to use and did use a significant portion of the funds for personal and non-business-related expenses.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition, the Criminal Division has also engaged in outreach to agencies tasked with implementing and overseeing CARES Act funds to design programs to detect and deter fraudulent conduct in the first instance. They are also coordinating with investigative agencies to identify key indicia of COVID-19/CARES Act related fraud schemes and to make sure information about emerging patterns and practices of fraudsters are shared across the relevant law enforcement community. Moreover, the Criminal Division is working closely with General Services Administration OIG, Department of Defense OIG, and Department of Homeland Security OIG, to ensure that taxpayers are not defrauded as the government seeks to procure large quantities of necessary equipment and services on an urgent timeframe.\n",
            "The Criminal Division has also assumed a leadership role in identifying and combating health care fraud trends emerging during the crisis, including by chairing a working group with FBI, HHS Office of Inspector General, and other law enforcement partners. Additionally, the Fraud Section has assigned 25 prosecutors to prosecute COVID-19 cases across the country, directed its Data Analytics Group to prioritize analysis of COVID-19-related billing schemes, and retained forensic accounting and other experts that will assist in investigations and prosecutions. These efforts have already led to prosecutions, including charges against a defendant in the Middle District of Florida, who, among other offenses, conspired to be paid kickbacks on a per-test basis for COVID-19 tests, provided that those tests were bundled with Respiratory Pathogen Panel tests, which reimburse at a far higher rate than COVID-19 tests.\n",
            "Since February, criminal and nation-state cyber actors have been increasingly targeting U.S. pharmaceutical, medical, and biological research facilities to acquire or manipulate sensitive information, to include COVID-19 vaccine and treatment research amid the evolving global pandemic. We have also seen various forms of fraudulent activity seeking to capitalize on the attention and concern that the pandemic demands and creates, including scam websites that are designed to look like legitimate charities, government agencies, healthcare organizations, or COVID-related information sources, but which fraudulently solicit donations, trick users into revealing passwords or other personal information, or distribute malicious code. The Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and the National Security Division are working with investigative agencies and U.S. Attorneys’ Offices to combat COVID-related cybercrime and intellectual property violations, particularly those that affect the healthcare sector.\n",
            "The Department has identified a variety of ongoing or potential fraudulent schemes. These include:\n",
            "\n",
            "Medicare beneficiaries receiving fraudulent calls, texts, and emails seeking to have the recipients disclose their personally identifiable information (PII) (e.g., social security numbers, dates of birth, and bank account routing and account numbers) under the auspices of confirming eligibility for COVID-19 tests, and then using that PII to bill health insurance programs for medically unnecessary, or not provided, services or equipment.\n",
            "Medical professionals offering free COVID-19 testing to obtain Medicare beneficiary information that can then be used to submit medical claims for unrelated and medically unnecessary – and far more expensive – tests or services, as well as the payment of kickbacks for referrals for such testing.\n",
            "Social media scams fraudulently seeking donations or claiming to provide COVID-19 relief funds if the recipient enters his or her bank account information.\n",
            "Scammers representing that they are acting on behalf of government agencies, including the SBA, U.S. Treasury, and other entities, in order to obtain money from individuals.\n",
            "Robocalls making fraudulent offers to sell respiratory masks with no intent of delivery.\n",
            "Sales of counterfeit or fake testing kits, cures, “immunity” pills, and protective equipment.\n",
            "Seeking donations fraudulently for illegitimate or non-existent charitable organizations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Federal prosecutors around the nation have undertaken investigations and have brought, or anticipate bringing, charges in connection with all of these fraud schemes.\n",
            "In addition, Department attorneys are focused on CARES Act fraud schemes connected to the Economic Impact Payments (EIP) program and state-sponsored unemployment benefit payments. The Department has received complaints of aggravated identity theft by perpetrators, including those overseas, who file false claims for EIP and unemployment benefits. The money is often routed through bank accounts and debit cards of third parties here in the U.S. from there, the proceeds are transferred to the perpetrators, many of whom are overseas.\n",
            "The Department’s investigations into this conduct involve multiple law enforcement agency partners. To date, federal law enforcement has flagged payments and recovered millions of dollars before the money has left the country, and we and federal investigative agencies are working toward pursuing all the perpetrators, including those overseas. In order to prosecute perpetrators of these schemes, we can charge wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and money laundering, among other crimes.\n",
            "Consumer Protection\n",
            "The Consumer Protection Branch of the Civil Division has taken action in federal court to combat fraud related to the COVID-19 pandemic by seeking to enjoin activity under Section 1345 of Title 18 of the United States Code to prevent harm to potential victims of fraudulent scams. For instance, on March 21, 2020, the Department filed suit in the Western District of Texas seeking to enjoin the operations of a website fraudulently claiming to sell COVID-19 vaccine kits purported to be from the World Health Organization. As there unfortunately is not yet a COVID-19 vaccine, the court promptly granted the Department’s request and issued a temporary restraining order requiring that the registrar of the fraudulent website immediately take action to block the public from accessing it.\n",
            "Since March, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) has received and reviewed thousands of complaints related to COVID-19 scams, referring complaints relating to websites or advertisements for fake COVID-19 vaccines and cures, fraudulent charities, and malware to the Consumer Protection Branch for review and, if warranted, action. As a result of the ongoing cooperative efforts between federal, state, and local law enforcement, and a number of private-sector companies, including multiple Internet domain providers and registrars, the FBI Cyber Division’s Cyber Initiative and Resource Fusion Unit has sent notifications on 1,000 domain names related to COVID-19 fraud, and over 800 of these domain name registrations have been suspended or otherwise mitigated. The Consumer Protection Branch, in coordination with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has also filed several enforcement actions seeking preliminary relief in order to protect consumers from illegal and potential harmful products being offered to treat COVID-19. These enforcement actions seek to swiftly shut down individuals and businesses selling unapproved products with misleading efficacy claims, products that are not only potentially dangerous but also may prevent those suffering from COVID-19 from receiving the healthcare they need. Federal district courts have agreed with the Department about these predatory schemes and have enjoined the unlawful sale of potentially dangerous products in several cases, including:\n",
            "U.S. v. Genesis II Church of Health and Healing (Southern District of Florida)\n",
            "\n",
            "On April 8, 2020, the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a Warning Letter to Genesis and its principals notifying them that, by selling a product called Miracle Mineral Solution and claiming that it will cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent COVID-19, Alzheimer’s, autism, brain cancer, HIV/AIDS, and multiple sclerosis, they are violating federal law by, among other things, distributing unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs in interstate commerce. Despite this warning, Genesis continued to sell this product and expressly stated that they would not take corrective action. As a result, on April 17, 2020, the Department filed suit to enjoin Genesis from selling Miracle Mineral Solution, and the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida promptly entered a temporary injunction halting its sale.\n",
            "\n",
            "U.S. v. Purity Health and Wellness Center (Northern District of Texas)\n",
            "\n",
            "The Department filed suit to enjoin the Purity Health and Wellness Center (Purity) from fraudulently touting its “ozone therapy” treatment as a COVID-19 treatment. Purity and its principals agreed to be bound by a permanent injunction barring them from representing that their “ozone therapy” could be used to treat or cure COVID-19.\n",
            "\n",
            "United States v. Gordon Pedersen, My Doctor Suggests LLV, and GP Silver LLC (District of Utah)\n",
            "\n",
            "The Department filed suit seeking to enjoin Pedersen, and his companies, from continuing to make false and misleading claims that Alkaline Structured Silver products, as sold by Pedersen, as a protection against and a treatment for COVID-19. The court promptly entered an injunction halting the sale of the fraudulent COVID-19 treatment.\n",
            "\n",
            "United States v. Xephyr LLC, d/b/a N-Ergetics (Eastern District of Oklahoma)\n",
            "\n",
            "The Department filed suit seeking to enjoin N-Ergetics from selling an unapproved colloidal silver product purporting to cure, mitigate, or treat COVID-19, as well as other diseases including pneumonia, AIDS, and cancer. The district court entered a temporary restraining order halting the unlawful sales, which prompted the defendants to immediately take down their sales site. In addition, the defendants offered refunds to customers in response to the enforcement action.\n",
            "\n",
            "United States v. Parris (District of Columbia)\n",
            "\n",
            "The Consumer Protection Branch, working with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, charged a Georgia man in federal court with fraud for attempting to sell millions of nonexistent respirator masks to the Department of Veterans Affairs in exchange for large upfront payments.\n",
            "\n",
            "Antitrust Enforcement\n",
            "The Department is also aware of the potential for firms to take advantage of the pandemic to engage in anticompetitive conduct such as price fixing and bid rigging. The Department issued a press release announcing its intention to hold accountable anyone who violates the antitrust laws of the U.S. in connection with the manufacturing, distribution, or sale of public health products such as face masks, respirators, and diagnostics. The Department is also watchful for collusive practices in the sale of such products to federal, state, and local agencies. In particular, the Department’s Procurement Collusion Strike Force (PCSF) is an interagency partnership leading a coordinated national response to combat antitrust crimes and related fraudulent schemes in government procurement, grant, and program funding at all levels of government. Deterrence and early detection of misconduct will be the PCSF’s top priorities to help these agencies safeguard their procurement, grant, and program funding processes from collusion and corruption.\n",
            "Additionally, the Department recognizes the risk to workers from anticompetitive conduct by employers. The Antitrust Division therefore issued a joint statement with the FTC noting that the nation’s antitrust enforcers are closely monitoring employer collusion to disadvantage workers during the pandemic. Specifically, the agencies announced that they will protect competition for workers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 response by enforcing the antitrust laws against those who seek to exploit the pandemic to suppress or eliminate competition for compensation, benefits, hours worked, and other terms of employment. Finally, the Department issued a joint statement with the FTC announcing an expedited procedure for reviewing proposed conduct by industry aimed at addressing responses to COVID-19 and determining whether they intend to take antitrust action in response. To date, the Department has issued three letters reviewing proposed conduct: one addressing collaborative efforts to increase the manufacturing and distribution of PPE; one aimed at increasing access to pharmaceuticals to treat the coronavirus; and a third aimed at addressing challenges faced by hog farmers.\n",
            "Child Exploitation\n",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic has raised other problems beyond fraud and other economic harms. The Department is gravely concerned that COVID-19 is leading to a higher incidence of online child sexual exploitation, because both offenders and children are spending more time at home and online, and because the use of videoconference platforms has increased.\n",
            "The best signal we have of the growing threat is chatter we are seeing on the Dark Net, where offenders are able to speak freely. The offenders clearly see COVID-19 as creating opportunities for child exploitation. As one individual wrote on March 21, 2020, “is nobody seeing the bright side of this pandemic?? Schools are closed so kids are at home bored … that means way more livestreams and its very clear moderators aren’t working right now since I’ve seen 3 hour streams go unbanned over the last few days where girls do whatever the f--- they want. What a time to be alive.”\n",
            "The FBI recently issued a warning about “Zoom disruptions,” where individuals enter meetings taking place on videoconference platforms and broadcast child sexual abuse material. According to the FBI, in the last three months they have received more than 300 reports of Zoom disruptions throughout the U.S. and in other countries.\n",
            "The Department is working with a variety of partners to try to mitigate the risk to children. For example, the FBI, in conjunction with U.S. and international law enforcement partners, has aggressively pursued leads relating to egregious child exploitation crimes, including the arrest last month of a defendant accused of enticing nearly a dozen boys online to send him sexually explicit imagery of themselves.\n",
            "We have also strongly supported efforts to prevent these crimes from occurring in the first place. The Department, along with our Five Eyes partners and the tech industry developed PSAs targeted at caregivers and children to make them aware of the increased risk of child sexual exploitation. In addition, the Department has a dedicated web page with information and resources related to COVID-19 and online child sexual exploitation, including how to report such crimes. The FBI is encouraging individuals to report Zoom disruptions, and has provided guidance on how to prevent such attacks.\n",
            "National Center for Disaster Fraud\n",
            "The Department wants to catch perpetrators of COVID-19-related crimes as quickly as possible, so we have set up a hotline and encouraged people to call if they believe they, or someone they know, are victims of a COVID-19 scam. The hotline is set up within the Department’s National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF). For approximately 15 years, the NCDF has been dedicated to improving the detection, prevention, investigation, and prosecution of criminal conduct related to natural and man-made disasters and other emergencies, such as COVID-19. As a national coordinating agency within the Department of Justice, the NCDF has the resources, training, and expertise to quickly and effectively ensure that all complaints are appropriately disseminated to the relevant federal, state, or local agency for further investigation.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the weeks since we announced the COVID-19 hotline, the Center has received thousands of contacts, most of which were addressed and referred by the hotline’s automated phone system. We will be updating the National Center for Disaster Fraud’s website to reflect the number of COVID-19 contacts we have received.\n",
            "Conclusion\n",
            "Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein, and members of the Committee, we would like to close by thanking you for this opportunity to share the good work of Department of Justice personnel all over the country to uncover and prosecute crimes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. We look forward to answering your questions.\n",

            "The president of a California-based medical technology company was charged in a complaint unsealed today in the Northern District of California, in connection with his alleged participation in schemes to mislead investors, to manipulate the company’s stock price and to conspire to commit health care fraud in connection with the submission of over $69 million in false and fraudulent claims for allergy and COVID-19 testing. \n",
            "The complaint against Mark Schena, 57, of Los Altos, California, the president of Arrayit Corporation, is the first criminal securities fraud prosecution related to the COVID-19 pandemic that has been brought by the Department of Justice and charges one count of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud. \n",
            "“This defendant allegedly defrauded Medicare through illegal kickbacks and bribes, and then turned to exploiting the pandemic by fraudulently promoting an unproven COVID-19 test to the market,” said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.  “Working together with our law enforcement partners, the Criminal Division is committed to safeguarding the integrity of the Medicare system and protecting the investing public from securities scams.”\n",
            "“The allure of cheap reliable alternatives to today’s standard blood tests panels has captured the imagination of the health care industry, making such alternatives a prime subject for fraudsters,” said U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson of the Northern District of California.  “The scheme described in the complaint, in which the defendant allegedly leveraged this allure by appending the fear of the COVID-19 pandemic, amounts to a cynical multi-million dollar hoax.”\n",
            "“Investigating COVID-19 fraud scams billed to federal health programs – such as those charged here – are a top priority for our agency,” said Special Agent in Charge Steven J. Ryan for the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS-OIG).  “The ongoing public health crisis has spawned a rash of fraudulent schemes; therefore, we will continue working with law enforcement partners to protect beneficiaries, programs and taxpayers.”\n",
            "“Those seeking to maximize profits while misleading investors should expect to pay a heavy price, especially now,” said Inspector in Charge Delany De Leon-Colon of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) – Criminal Investigations Group.  “The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is proud to work alongside the Department of Justice and our other law enforcement partners to identify and investigate anyone who capitalizes on this pandemic to commit fraud. By working together, we can keep our communities and our vulnerable populations safe from financial exploitation.”\n",
            "“Scams that trade on the VA’s name to portray an air of credibility will not be tolerated,” said Special Agent in Charge Kim R. Lampkins of the Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (VA OIG). “These charges reflect the VA OIG’s commitment to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate any fraudulent schemes that affect VA’s COVID-19 testing or other responses to the pandemic.”\n",
            "“Today’s unsealing of the criminal complaint and the subsequent arrest of Mr. Schena are significant steps forward in this case to root out fraud and corruption being committed against the U.S. healthcare system, including the Department of Defense’s TRICARE program,” said Special Agent in Charge Bryan D. Denny, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Western Field Office.  “Any attempts to subvert the integrity of the TRICARE program, especially as we all are struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, will be aggressively investigated and prosecuted, if appropriate, to preserve and recover precious taxpayer dollars.”\n",
            "According to the affidavit in support of the complaint, Schena touted that Arrayit is the “only laboratory in the world that offers” revolutionary “microarray technology” that allows Arrayit to test for allergy and COVID-19 based on a drop of blood that is 250,000 times smaller than the technology touted by Theranos. \n",
            "Beginning in or around 2018 and continuing to in or around February 2020, Schena and others paid kickbacks and bribes to recruiters and doctors to run an allergy screening test for 120 allergens (including things ranging from stinging insects to food allergens) on every patient regardless of medical necessity, and then made numerous misrepresentations to potential investors about Arrayit’s allergy test sales, financial condition, and its future prospects.  Schena and others issued press releases and tweeted about partnerships with Fortune 500 companies, government agencies and public institutions, without disclosing that such partnerships either did not exist or were of de minimis value. \n",
            "As the COVID-19 crisis began to escalate in March 2020, Schena and others made false claims concerning Arrayit’s ability to provide accurate, fast, reliable and cheap COVID-19 tests in compliance with state and federal regulations, and made numerous misrepresentations to potential investors about the COVID-19 tests and Arrayit’s future prospects for COVID-19 testing. \n",
            "Schena stated that it was simple to develop a test for COVID-19 because the switch from testing for allergies to testing for COVID-19 was “like a pastry chef” who switches from selling “strawberry pies” to selling “rhubarb and strawberry pies.”  Arrayit’s stock price doubled in mid-March, but Schena and others never disclosed that there were questions about the validity of its data and the accuracy of its COVID-19 test. \n",
            "A complaint is merely an allegation and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. \n",
            "Anyone with information about allegations of attempted fraud involving COVID-19 can report it by calling the Department of Justice’s National Center for Disaster Fraud Hotline at 866-720-5721 or via the NCDF Web Complaint Form at: https://www.justice.gov/disaster-fraud/ncdf-disaster-complaint-form.\n",

            "Date: 6/07/2020\n",
            "Link: https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdga/pr/us-attorney-pushes-increased-response-eradicate-sexual-harassment-housing-amid-covid-19\n",
            "Press Release:\n",
            "MACON, Ga. – Charlie Peeler, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, is urging law enforcement and community partners to join with the United States Attorney’s Office in eradicating sexual harassment in housing amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In a message sent to law enforcement and community partners across the Middle District last week, U.S. Attorney Peeler reminded stakeholders that sexual harassment by landlords, property managers, maintenance workers and others, with control over housing may violate the federal Fair Housing Act. The Department of Justice (DOJ), through the Civil Rights Division and United States Attorney’s Offices, remains unwavering in the enforcement of this vital statute.\n",
            "“As a result of the COVID-19 public health crisis, many in our communities have found themselves out of work, furloughed, or otherwise in dire financial straits. As a result, folks have been forced to seek abatements or suspensions of their rent, or seek other accommodations during this time.  While many landlords and housing providers have responded with understanding, there are reports that others have seen an opportunity to exploit the financially vulnerable through demands for sexual acts and other unwelcome sexual conduct. This appalling behavior is illegal and will not be tolerated,” stated U.S. Attorney Peeler in his message to law enforcement and community partners.\n",
            "The Fair Housing act prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin and disability. Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination under the Fair Housing Act.

            "\"We thank Governor Kate Brown for extending religious freedom protections to people of faith as part of Phase 2 of the Reopening Oregon Plan.  Places of worship in counties that qualify for Phase 2 will be able, based on an order issued by the governor Thursday, to hold gatherings with social distancing and hygiene measures for up to 250 people, depending on the size of the facility.  Phase 1 raised some concerns about discrimination against places of worship by limiting them to 25 congregants, regardless of social distancing and hygiene measures, while allowing restaurants and fitness classes to operate with no numerical cap so long as they engaged in social distancing and adhered to hygiene measures.  Governor Brown’s new guidelines will allow places of worship that choose to reopen with the flexibility they need to serve their congregations while undertaking social distancing and hygiene protocols.\n",
            "“The right to the free exercise of religion is one of our most cherished rights, and the Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that this right, and other fundamental rights, are preserved during the COVID-19 pandemic.  As Attorney General Barr has stated, ‘even in times of emergency, when reasonable and temporary restrictions are placed on rights, the First Amendment and federal statutory law prohibit discrimination against religious institutions and religious believers.’  The Department of Justice will continue to prioritize Attorney General Barr’s Memorandum regarding Balancing Public Safety with the Preservation of Civil Rights.\n",

            "Date: 6/04/2020\n",
            "Link: https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/us-attorney-mcswain-and-pa-attorney-general-shapiro-warn-pennsylvanians-coronavirus\n",
            "Press Release:\n",
            "PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney William M. McSwain and Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro issued a warning to Pennsylvanians today to be alert to fraudsters using stolen identities to try to obtain Coronavirus Stimulus Funds. \n",
            "The Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry (DLI) has reported that individuals are filing claims with stolen identities for Pennsylvania Unemployment Assistance (PUA). The PUA Program is administered by the DLI as part of the Federal Stimulus and is intended to benefit workers who have lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. Attorney McSwain and Attorney General Shapiro announced that federal and state law enforcement will aggressively pursue and prosecute anyone perpetrating this type of fraud.\n",
            "“Fraud like this causes great harm to many citizens at a time when they are most vulnerable,” said U.S. Attorney McSwain. “It is especially intolerable that criminals are trying to take advantage of an unprecedented public health emergency. My Office and the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office will not tolerate it, and we will do everything in our collective power to ensure that such fraud scams are stopped and punished.”\n",
            "“Scammers are working overtime during this crisis and trying to take advantage of the nearly 1 in 3 Pennsylvanians who have lost a job. We will not let anyone ripoff the public and the millions who are out of work,” said Attorney General Shapiro. “Our offices are using every resource at the state and federal level to figure out who these criminals are and put a stop to this theft. If you get a check you didn’t apply for or a deposit you are questioning, please contact our offices. We need the public’s help to address these crimes.”\n",
            "According to the DLI, in one version of the fraud, the thieves use stolen identities of employed people to file claims for PUA, but direct that the money be sent to the fraudsters’ own bank accounts. Since discovering this scheme, DLI has taken steps to route PUA funds to the individuals named in the applications in order to prevent the thieves from receiving the stolen funds. As a result, victims of identity theft may only learn that their personal identifying information was stolen when they improperly receive a Pennsylvania unemployment compensation check, or a direct deposit of unemployment benefits, for which they never applied. \n",
            "If any Pennsylvanian believes they have been a victim of this type of fraud or identity theft, U.S. Attorney McSwain and Attorney General Shapiro provided the following guidance:\n",
            "\n",
            "If you receive a paper check for unemployment benefits in the mail but did not file for such benefits in Pennsylvania, do not cash the check.\n",
            "Likewise, if you receive a direct deposit for unemployment benefits but did not file for such benefits in Pennsylvania, do not use the funds. The Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry website contains detailed instructions for returning the money. \n",
            "In addition, it is very important that victims report suspected identity theft to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry. A form is available on the Department’s website: DLI.PA.GOV. Identity theft and fraud can also be reported to the Department using its Fraud Hotline 1-800-692-7469. This information will be shared with law enforcement to investigate this suspected criminal activity.\n",
            "\n",

            "NEWARK, N.J. – A Chinese manufacturer was charged today with producing and exporting to the United States in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic nearly half a million misbranded and defective masks that falsely purported to be N95 respirators, U.S. Attorneys Craig Carpenito, District of New Jersey, and Richard P. Donoghue, Eastern District of New York, announced.\n",
            "King Year Packaging and Printing Co. Ltd. (King Year) is charged by complaint with three counts of violating the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) for causing misbranded and substandard respirators that falsely purported to meet the N95 standard to be imported into the United States. The complaint also charges the defendant with one felony count of making a false statement by filing misleading registration documents with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The criminal complaint was filed in Brooklyn federal court.\n",
            "“These charges demonstrate the continued commitment of the Department of Justice and our partners to aggressively pursue those who sell misbranded and defective personal protective equipment, whether they are located here or abroad,” Carpenito said. “We will aggressively investigate and charge manufacturers that put our medical professionals and first responders at risk in fighting this crisis.”\n",
            "“The charges alleged in this complaint show a blatant disregard for the safety of American citizens,” Acting FBI-Newark Special Agent in Charge Douglas Korneski said. “Had it not been for the actions of the investigative team, this defendant would have put first responders, hospital employees, and other front line workers directly in harm’s way with faulty equipment just to make a buck. The defendant tried to bypass the government's regulations by misbranding the quality of the equipment being peddled. The FBI remains vigilant in the pursuit of criminals trying to exploit the current crisis.”\n",
            "Attorney General William P. Barr created the COVID-19 Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force, led by U.S. Attorney Carpenito, who is coordinating efforts with the Antitrust Division and U.S. Attorneys across the country wherever illegal activity involving protective personal equipment occurs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has issued a notice designating categories of health and medical supplies that must not be hoarded or sold for exorbitant prices.\n",
            "“U.S. Customs and Border Protection is proud of the expertise we bring to support and assist investigations by our law enforcement partners,” Troy Miller, Director, CBP New York Field Office, said.  “It is through interagency partnerships and collaborative efforts, like the one leading to today’s charges that we send a message to foreign manufacturers on the importance of understanding and complying with US health, safety, and import laws.”\n",
            "“The FDA is actively monitoring the marketplace for fraudulent products related to our battle against COVID-19. The agency will continue to collaborate with our fellow law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who place profits above the public health during this pandemic,” Jeffrey J. Ebersole, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ New York Field Office, said. “Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder that we will take appropriate action against those who jeopardize the health of Americans while taking advantage of a crisis.”\n",
            "According to the complaint:\n",
            "From April 6, 2020, to April 21, 2020, King Year manufactured 495,200 defective and misbranded masks that claimed to be N95 respirators, and caused those defective products to be imported into the United States. King Year stamped the NIOSH and FDA logos on the packaging for its respirators, appealing directly to healthcare personnel, when in fact, its respirators were not NIOSH-approved, nor were they approved, cleared, or otherwise authorized by the FDA. King Year’s respirators also were embroidered with “N95,” even though they fell well below the minimum 95 percent filtration standard.\n",
            "King Year’s misbranded and defective products had the potential to deceive U.S. consumers, including healthcare workers and first responders, into believing they were purchasing authentic N95 respirators, and put them at risk. To cover up the poor quality of its respirators, King Year disseminated false documents attesting to their authenticity and filed a fraudulent registration statement with the FDA.\n",
            "Each charge carries a maximum fine of $500,000 or the greater of twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss from the offense.\n",
            "Please report COVID-19 fraud, hoarding or price-gouging to the National Center for Disaster Fraud’s National Hotline at (866) 720-5721, or e-mail: disaster@leo.gov.\n",

            "The complaint further alleges that Baker submitted paperwork with his loan application representing that Motorcity Solar Energy Inc. had 68 employees and, in 2019 paid wages, tips, and other compensation totaling $2.8 million. In fact, the state of Michigan had dissolved Motorcity Solar Energy Inc.’s status as a corporation in July 2019. All of Motorcity’s purported business locations were either empty suites or single-family residences, with no evidence of business activity. And Motorcity never established any account with the State of Michigan’s unemployment insurance program, which is a prerequisite for any valid employer in the state. \n",
            "The complaint further alleges that, in the two days after the loan was funded, Baker purchased four cashiers checks and withdraw an additional $60,000 in cash. None of these cashier’s checks went to payroll or other business expenses. Indeed, Baker used the four cashiers checks to purchase two Cadillac Escalades, a Dodge Charger, and a Hummer.  According to the complaint, Baker purchased one of vehicles for his brother-in-law and one for his sister; the remaining two vehicles Baker kept for his own use and enjoyment.\n",
            "United States Attorney Schneider stated “Defendant Baker is charged with lying to obtain money that was supposed to help small businesses struggling with their payroll and expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Defrauding banks to obtain loans is never acceptable, and doing so during our current national emergency is unconscionable.  This prosecution is yet another example of our office’s commitment to holding accountable anyone who would exploit the COVID-19 crisis for their own greedy desires.” \n",
            "“The Paycheck Protection Program is designed as a lifeline to businesses struggling to survive this current crisis. Instead of using these loans to salvage a legitimate business, the defendant allegedly bought expensive personal items for himself and his family,” said SAC D’Antuono. “These actions harmed hard-working Americans and deserving small businesses. The FBI is committed to investigating anyone who seeks to take advantage of a global pandemic to line their own pockets at the expense of American taxpayers.”\n",
            "A complaint is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt.  Trial cannot be held on felony charges in a complaint.  When the investigation is completed a determination will be made whether to seek a felony indictment.\n",
            "The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney John K. Neal. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI.\n",

            "“Following action by the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, Governor Whitmer provided much-needed relief for Michiganders by rescinding her executive orders which had required certain retail business to operate ‘by appointment only,’ prohibited other businesses that sued the governor from having the face-to-face meetings necessary to operate, even while practicing social distancing, and had required Michiganders to stay home.”\n",

            "NEWPORT NEWS, Va. – A federal grand jury returned an indictment today charging a Norfolk man with submitting fraudulent disaster-related loan applications in connection with the COVID-19 outbreak that resulted in the disbursement of over $190,000 in proceeds.\n",
            "“The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our communities in innumerable ways,” said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. “The CARES Act provides emergency relief to help mitigate some of those effects. Fraud targeting CARES Act benefits unjustly diverts these resources away from the people and businesses who most need them. EDVA remains steadfastly committed to prosecuting those who seek to exploit this crisis for their own personal gain.”\n",
            "According to the indictment, from at least March 2020 to May 2020, Joseph Cherry II, 39, allegedly engaged in a scheme to fraudulently obtain disaster-related loan benefits in the form of United States Small Business Administration (SBA) sponsored Economic Injury Disaster (EIDL) loans and a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan. These SBA programs, initiated and expanded under The CARES Act, are designed to provide support for small businesses for expenses related to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n",
            "“Providing false statements to gain access to SBA’s programs will be aggressively investigated by our office,” said Hannibal “Mike” Ware, Inspector General of the U.S. Small Business Administration. “SBA OIG and its law enforcement partners are poised to root out fraud in SBA’s programs and bring wrongdoers to justice. I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”\n",
            "This kind of fraud reaches deep into the community by diverting critical funds intended to help struggling businesses survive and help people hold onto their livelihoods. It is unconscionable that anyone would attempt to steal from the community using the CARES Act to line their own pockets during this national crisis. The FBI is committed to rooting out this kind of fraud to help ensure these critical funds go where they are needed most. Anyone with information on CARES Act and other COVID-19 related fraud is asked to submit a tip to the FBI at tips.fbi.gov.”\n",
            "According to the indictment, Cherry, who was serving a term of federal supervised release, allegedly submitted applications for these loans that contained false statements and misrepresentations related to his income, employment, claimed business entities and prior criminal record. The indictment alleges that Cherry fraudulently obtained proceeds of over $190,000 in April 2020. Further, in a few day period, Cherry converted to cash or a cashier’s check approximately $140,000 of these proceeds.\n",
            "“The immediacy with which the Deputy Marshals responded in making this arrest should send a clear message to those intending to misuse the financial resources our government is providing to those trying to recover from the ongoing pandemic,” said Nick E. Proffitt, U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of Virginia. “The public should take comfort in knowing that even in this difficult COVID-19 environment, Deputy United States Marshals are at work each and every day to help ensure the community is safe, and justice is served.”\n",
            "Cherry is charged in a 10-count indictment with charges of wire fraud, theft of government property, false statements to the small business administration, and money laundering. If convicted, he faces statutory maximums ranging from 10 to 30 years in prison on each count. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n",
            "“Unfortunately, during these uncertain times, individuals fraudulently take advantage of programs meant to help those in need,” said Kelly R. Jackson, the IRS-CI Special Agent in Charge.  “We will prioritize investigations of these shameless perpetrators and work with our law enforcement partners to bring these individuals to justice.”\n",
            "The Department of Justice remains vigilant in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting wrongdoing related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the leadership of Attorney General William Barr, U.S. Attorneys appointed Coronavirus Fraud Coordinators to work with federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement partners to protect the public from scammers who are attempting to prey upon fears. The Department is also committed to preventing hoarding and price gouging for critical supplies during this crisis.

This program allows eligible state, local and tribal governments to apply immediately for these critical funds. Since the program’s launch in early April, OJP has awarded over $661 million to 963 state, local and tribal agencies and organizations. Eleven Maine jurisdictions have received a total of over $4 million. A list of all awards can be found here.\n",

            "The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act gives jurisdictions considerable latitude in the use of funds for dealing with COVID-19. Potential uses include hiring personnel, paying overtime, purchasing protective equipment and distributing resources to hard-hit areas. Funds may also be used to help correctional facilities cover costs related to COVID-19, including, but not limited to, sanitation, contagion prevention and measures designed to address the related medical needs of inmates, detainees and correctional personnel. \n",
            "Today is the deadline for jurisdictions to apply for grants. OJP will fund successful applicants on a rolling basis as it receives applications. Grantees may apply the funds retroactively to January 20, 2020, subject to federal rules.\n",

Zachary Terwilliger today announced that various jurisdictions across the Eastern District of Virginia have recently been awarded over $764,000 in Department of Justice grants to respond to the public safety challenges posed by the outbreak of COVID-19.\n",
            "The grants, to the cities of Norfolk ($564,663), Manassas ($41,306), Fredericksburg ($43,658) and Loudoun County ($114,472), are available under the Coronavirus Emergency Supplemental Funding program, authorized by the recent stimulus legislation signed by President Trump. The Justice Department is moving quickly, awarding grants on a rolling basis and aiming to have funds available for drawdown as soon as possible after receiving applications.\n",
            "“Those on the front lines of the public safety response to the coronavirus have our support, gratitude, and utmost respect,” said Terwilliger. “The Department of Justice provides this funding with significant flexibility, so that state and local departments can use it in the ways that best benefit their officers and their community.”\n",
            "The grants come on the heels of a separate DOJ grants of over $12 million to the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services, City of Petersburg, City of Alexandria, County of Hanover, City of Suffolk, Town of Leesburg, Town of Stafford, James City County, City of Chesapeake, Henrico County, and Chesterfield County, announced earlier this month.\n",
            "“The outbreak of COVID-19 and the public health emergency it created are sobering reminders that even the most routine duties performed by our nation’s public safety officials carry potentially grave risks,” said Katharine T. Sullivan, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs. “These funds will provide hard-hit communities with critical resources to help mitigate the impact of this crisis and give added protection to the brave professionals charged with keeping citizens safe.”\n",

Barr's April 27, 2020 initiative directing Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Eric Dreiband, and the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, Matthew Schneider, to review state and local policies to ensure that civil liberties are protected during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",
            "“Especially during a crisis like this, the ability of people of faith to be able to exercise their religion is essential,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division. “Colorado has offered no good reason for not trusting congregants who promise to use care in worship the same way it trusts diners inside a restaurant, or accountants, realtors or lawyers to do the same. The U.S. Department of Justice will continue to take action if states and localities infringe on the free exercise of religion or other civil liberties.”\n",
            "“We appreciate the challenging position that the state and the governor face in trying to balance public safety with personal and religious freedoms,” said Jason Dunn, U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado. “But when government restrictions cross the line into unconstitutional violations of religious liberty, it is my duty and that of the Department of Justice to engage and protect those interests.”\n",
            "“As important as it is that we stay safe during these challenging times, it is also important for states to remember that we do not abandon all of our freedoms in times of emergency,” said Matthew Schneider, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, who, with Assistant Attorney General Dreiband, is overseeing the Justice Department’s effort to monitor state and local polices relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Unlawful discrimination against people who exercise their right to religion violates the First Amendment, whether we are in a pandemic or not.” \n",
            "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Colorado’s Governor and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) have issued various orders imposing limitations on in-person gatherings and, more recently, less restrictive rules for indoor service at restaurants. The guidance provides expressly that “[i]ndoor dine-in service can be held at 50% of the posted occupancy code limit and a maximum of 50 patrons,” if social distancing between parties of “eight people or fewer” is maintained, masks are worn, and other precautions are met. The rules for religious services in a place of worship are significantly more restrictive. Under guidance issued by CDPHE, religious gatherings inside a place of worship are permitted only “if physical distancing is observed and the gatherings are of 10 or fewer people in each room.” Places of worship thus are not allowed to host more than ten worshippers, even if they socially distance, and whether or not they are in the same party — unlike various businesses, including marijuana dispensaries, legal, accounting and real estate services, which may admit numerous customers into a single space so long as those customers socially distance, and unlike restaurants, which have been exempted from the public gathering limits and now may seat 50 customers, who may sit in parties where the members of the party are not socially distanced. \n",
            "In its statement of interest, the United States explains that because Colorado appears to be treating similarly situated non-religious activity, such as in-person dining in restaurants, better than places of worship these actions may constitute a violation of the church’s constitutional right to the free exercise of religion.\n",

            "The Department of Justice today filed a statement of interest in a Maine federal court in support of a lawsuit filed by campgrounds in Maine—and New Hampshire residents who wish to enjoy them—challenging a measure by Governor Janet Mills in response to COVID‑19 that treats Maine residents more favorably than out-of-state residents when they seek to patronize campgrounds and RV parks within Maine. \n",
            "The Statement of Interest is part of Attorney General William P. Barr’s April 27, 2020 initiative directing Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division, and the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, Matthew Schneider, to review state and local policies to ensure that civil liberties are protected during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",
            "“The United States Constitution requires government to protect the privileges and immunities of all citizens in our nation,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division.  “These privileges and immunities include the right of Americans to travel freely anywhere in our country, and state governments cannot limit the right of out-of-state Americans to travel to their state unless doing so is substantially related to protecting the public safety.  The Department of Justice remains committed to defending the constitutional rights of all Americans no matter where they live. The department will continue to be especially vigilant of any infringement on the right to travel that unduly harms the ability of Americans to earn a living and support their families.”\n",
            "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Governor of Maine has issued Executive Orders that have continued to inflict significant economic harm on campground businesses.  On April 3, 2020, the Governor required campground and RV parks to close and also compelled “any person, resident or non-resident, traveling into Maine” to “immediately self-quarantine for 14 days” unless that person was engaged in “essential services.”  On April 29, the Governor issued another Executive Order, which incorporates a “Restarting Plan.”  The Restarting Plan provides that the State’s “Campgrounds/RV parks” will be “[o]pen to Maine residents only on May 22” and “[o]pen to out-of-state residents who have completed quarantine guidelines on June 1.” \n",
            "Maine’s self-quarantine requirement has contributed to the significant economic harm being suffered by campground businesses that rely on out-of-state patrons each summer for their income.  For example, the yearly revenue for plaintiff Little Ossipee Campground, a small family business in Waterboro, Maine has fallen by over $90,000.  Similarly, plaintiff Bayley’s Campground has received over 700 reservation cancellations, refunded over $150,000 in reservation fees, and lost over $260,000 in revenue. \n",
            "These campgrounds, along with New Hampshire residents who wish to enjoy them, brought a constitutional challenge on May 15 against various aspects of the Governor’s Orders.  According to plaintiffs, requiring only out-of-state residents to self-quarantine before patronizing campgrounds in Maine violates the federal constitutional right to interstate travel. \n",
            "In its statement of interest, the United States explains that Maine’s quarantine requirement discriminates between Maine residents and out-of-state residents.  This discrimination appears to be inadequately tailored to further public safety and therefore does not comply with the Constitution.  Maine’s Executive Orders are imposing devastating economic costs on the plaintiff campgrounds with a requirement that is both overinclusive and underinclusive to meet its objective and for which Maine could use less restrictive means to advance its interest in protecting public safety.\n",

            "“Registration under FIFRA helps ensure that pesticides sold in the U.S. work and are safe for humans. The trafficking in snake-oil remedies outside of FIFRA is a criminal act and anyone who does so, especially during this pandemic, will find federal law enforcement ready to stop them,” said Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. “The U.S. Department of Justice will not stand by while criminal conduct risks people’s health and safety.”\n",

            "Under FIFRA, the EPA regulates the production, sale, distribution and use of pesticides in the United States.  A pesticide is any substance intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest, which includes viruses.  Pesticides must be registered with the EPA. Toamit Virus Shut Out was not registered, and it is illegal to distribute or sell unregistered pesticides.  Sun imported the pesticide from Japan and later sold it to individuals around the United States.\n",

            "“I am proud that the Department of Justice has prioritized the fight against sexual harassment in housing.  My office will act aggressively against such violations of federal law and fundamental decency,” stated U.S. Attorney Bash.\n",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the ability of many people to pay their rent on time and has increased the lack of home security. The Justice Department has received reports that housing providers are trying to take advantage of the crisis to sexually harass tenants. Sexual harassment in housing is illegal and the Department of Justice is prepared to investigate such allegations and pursue, where appropriate, law enforcement measures.\n",
            "The Department of Justice's Home Sexual Harassment Initiative is an effort to combat sexual harassment in housing led by the Civil Rights Division, in collaboration with federal prosecutors across the country. The Initiative aims to address sexual harassment by homeowners, property managers, maintenance workers, lenders, or others who control housing.\n",
            "Since its launch in 2017, the Initiative has filed lawsuits across the country, alleging a pattern or practice of sexual harassment in housing and has recovered millions of dollars in damages for victims of harassment. Justice Department investigations often reveal cases of sexual harassment that have persisted for years. Many individuals do not know that being harassed by a housing provider may be a violation of federal laws or that the Department of Justice could help.\n",

            "PHOENIX, Ariz. – The United States Attorney’s Office unsealed three criminal complaints filed in Federal District Court charging multiple individuals with health care fraud associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",
            "“Now more than ever, the integrity of our healthcare system is paramount as we fight a global pandemic,” said United States Attorney Michael Bailey. “We remain committed to rooting out and prosecuting any individual who would use this crisis as an opportunity to defraud individuals or the government.”\n",
            "One complaint charges Jeremiah Faber, 45, of Gold Canyon, Arizona, the CEO of Harmony Healthcare, LLC dba Harmony Medical Care, with one count of health care fraud and one count of money laundering. The complaint alleges that Faber used Harmony’s Facebook and other social media sources to offer free COVID-19 testing if patients also completed Harmony’s Comprehensive Whole-Body Assessment. Harmony then fraudulently submitted claims for reimbursement to Mercy Care, Arizona’s health care benefit program, by billing for services that were medically unnecessary and for services provided in the names of physicians who had no role in the assessment.\n",
            "Two other complaints charge a total of six individuals associated with five Phoenix-area businesses that purport to provide non-emergency medical transportation services on the Navajo Nation. The first complaint charges Abdul Raheem Abdul Jabbar, Nohad Loabneh, and Abedelhalim Lawabni with conspiring to commit health care fraud. The complaint alleges that Abdul Jabbar, Loabneh, and Lawabni falsely billed Arizona’s Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS) for more than 9,000 non-emergency medical transports in April 2020 when those transports never occurred. After the Arizona Governor and the President of the Navajo Nation both declared COVID-19 public emergencies, the need for non-emergency medical transports dramatically decreased. The complaint further alleges that their false billings in April 2020 generated a total of more than $2.75 million in fraudulent payments from AHCCCS to the three businesses. AHCCCS is Arizona’s Medicaid agency, offering health care programs to low-income Arizona residents. Loabneh, and Lawabni own and operate A&N Services, LLC. Abdul Jabbar owns and operates Freedom AZ, LLC, and is also affiliated with Desert Mobile, LLC.\n",
            "The second complaint charges Miguel Denga, Husam Alsadi, and Tamarria Denga with conspiring to commit health care fraud. The complaint alleges that Alsadi and the Dengas falsely billed AHCCCS for more than 1,500 non-emergency medical transports in April 2020 when those transports never occurred. As noted above, after the Governor of Arizona and the President of the Navajo Nation both declared COVID-19 public emergencies, the need for non-emergency medical transports dramatically decreased. The complaint further alleges that their false billings in April 2020 generated a total of more than $450,000 in fraudulent payments from AHCCCS to the two businesses. Miguel Denga and Alsadi own and operate Philia Homecare, LLC. Tamarria Denga owns and operates COS 1, LLC.\n",
            "“Fraudsters are using the uncertainty around COVID-19 to line their pockets,” said Sean Kaul, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Phoenix Field Office. “Thanks to the diligent work of Arizona’s COVID-19 Fraud Task Force, the FBI identified and dismantled fraud rings in Arizona which were trying to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. Make no mistake, the FBI will actively pursue those seeking to fraudulently profit from the pandemic. The FBI thanks the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG), and the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Office of the Inspector General (AHCCCS-OIG) for their partnerships and collaboration on these cases. Their work was vital to these investigations.”\n",
            "Jeremiah Faber is scheduled to make his initial appearance in court on June 30, 2020. The other six defendants are scheduled to make their initial appearances in court on June 11, 2020.   \n",

            "Cooper, age 47, of Dry Fork, West Virginia, is charged with “Attempt to Defraud the Residents of West Virginia of a Fair Election.” According to the affidavit filed with the complaint, Cooper held a U.S. Postal Service contract to deliver mail in Pendleton County. In April 2020, the Clerk of Pendleton County received “2020 Primary Election COVID-19 Mail-In Absentee Request\" forms from eight voters on which the voter's party-ballot request appeared to have been altered.\n",
            "The clerk reported the finding to the West Virginia Secretary of State’s office, which began an investigation. The investigation found five ballot requests that had been altered from “Democrat” to “Republican.” On three other requests, the party wasn’t changed, but the request had been altered. \n",
            "Cooper was responsible for the mail delivery of the three towns from which the tampered requests were mailed: Onego, Riverton, and Franklin, West Virginia. According to the affidavit, Cooper admitted to altering some of the requests, saying it was a joke. \n",

Fitzhugh, the Special Agent in Charge of the New York Office of Homeland Security Investigations (“HSI”), Philip R. Bartlett, Inspector in Charge of the New York Office of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (“USPIS”), and Raymond Donovan, Special Agent in Charge of the New York Office of the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), announced the arrest today of RICHARD SCHIRRIPA, a/k/a “the Mask Man,” a licensed pharmacist, on charges of violating the Defense Production Act by hoarding and price gouging scarce N95 masks; making two false statements to law enforcement; committing healthcare fraud; and committing aggravated identity theft.  SCHIRRIPA surrendered today and will be presented before U.S. Magistrate Judge Ona T. Wang in Manhattan federal court.\n",
            "Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:  “As alleged, Richard Schirripa exploited an unprecedented crisis to engage in profiteering.  He allegedly spent over $200,000 accumulating N95 masks and then sold masks at inflated prices, charging customers up to 50% more than he had paid to acquire those N95 masks.  As alleged, during a sale to an undercover officer, Schirripa said, ‘I feel like a drug dealer.’  He also allegedly committed several additional, unrelated crimes, including lying to law enforcement, defrauding Medicare and Medicaid, and exploiting the personal information of his pharmacy’s customers to fill prescriptions.”\n",
            "HSI Special Agent in Charge Peter C. Fitzhugh said:  “At this time when our nation is battling the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect that our healthcare professionals are standing in solidarity with us, the defendant, Richard Schirripa, a licensed pharmacist, allegedly sought to capitalize and profit from the suffering of others.  As the pandemic was starting to take shape in March and April of 2020, Schirripa allegedly began hoarding desperately needed Personal Protection Equipment (PPE).  As demand for the PPE was peaking, he then purportedly took the opportunity to sell the hoarded PPE at prices as much as 50% above his acquisition costs.  HSI, along with law enforcement partners, and the United States Attorney’s Office, Southern District of New York, will tirelessly pursue those in our society who choose to put their personal greed and gain ahead of the laws of the United States and our fellow citizens.”\n",
            "USPIS Inspector in Charge Philip R. Bartlett said:  “As alleged, Mr. Schirripa chose to amass a stockpile of PPE, specifically N95 masks, which were desperately needed for the safety of frontline workers.  He then allegedly used this crisis to jack up the price of this equipment. Thankfully, the ‘mask man’ has been unmasked by law enforcement and brought to justice for his alleged greedy crimes.”\n",
            "DEA Special Agent in Charge Raymond Donovan said:  “There is no place in our city for a licensed pharmacist to allegedly victimize New Yorkers, especially at a time when people’s priority is their health and safety.   I applaud our law enforcement partners for their collaborative efforts throughout this investigation.” \n",
            "According to the allegations in the Complaint unsealed today[1]:\n",
            "SCHIRRIPA engaged in at least three different criminal schemes: (1) hoarding and price gouging of thousands of N95 masks in late March and April 2020, in violation of the Defense Production Act (“DPA”); (2) lying to officers of the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) on two occasions in early 2020; and (3) causing Medicare and Medicaid to be billed for prescriptions based on false representations, from 2014 to 2019, as well as using his pharmacy patients’ identifying information, without authorization, in connection with his health care fraud scheme.\n",
            "As for the first scheme, from at least late March to April 2020, during the COVID-19 global pandemic, SCHIRRIPA engaged in hoarding and price gouging of thousands of 3M N95 masks.  Between February and April 8, 2020, SCHIRRIPA purchased at least approximately $200,000 worth of N95 masks.  On March 25, 2020, the DPA was invoked, making it a crime to engage in hoarding or price gouging of specified equipment, including the types of masks SCHIRRIPA had.  SCHIRRIPA admitted to law enforcement that he was aware of the DPA and its restrictions on price gouging and hoarding.  Nevertheless, in the two weeks after March 25, 2020, SCHIRRIPA (1) continued to add to his stockpile of N95 masks by buying thousands of additional N95 masks; and (2) charged his customers inflated prices in connection with at least approximately 50 sales that, together, yielded approximately $50,000 in sales revenue.  For instance, SCHIRRIPA charged up to $25 per mask for a mask that he purchased for $20 per mask and that generally costs an end-user only approximately $1.27, according to 3M, the manufacturer.  Moreover, SCHIRRIPA purchased another model of 3M N95 mask for $10 and repeatedly resold it for as much as $15, which constitutes a markup of 50%.  His customers were in eight states and included funeral homes and doctors.  Agents recovered approximately 6,660 masks from SCHIRRIPA.\n",
            "SCHIRRIPA made various statements during this scheme.  During a recorded call with an undercover agent (the “UC”), SCHIRRIPA said, “We’re in a time of emergency and shortage,” but added, “when you have something no one else has, it’s not a high price.”  In a text message dated April 2, 2020, SCHIRRIPA bragged to a potential customer that he “saw it coming” and the “good thing is no one has them.”  SCHIRRIPA repeatedly sold masks out of his car, including to the UC; during that sale, SCHIRRIPA told the UC, “I feel like a drug dealer standing out here.” \n",
            "Second, in both January and February 2020, SCHIRRIPA made material false statements to the DEA.  On each occasion, SCHIRRIPA falsely represented that as part of the recent closure of his pharmacy in New York, New York, he had transferred to others, sold, or destroyed all controlled substances.  In fact, SCHIRRIPA remained in possession of thousands of controlled substance pills/patches, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and oxymorphone.  These substances were all recovered from a safe in SCHIRRIPA’s home.  When agents executed a search warrant at SCHIRRIPA’s home in April 2020, SCHIRRIPA acknowledged that these controlled substances were from his pharmacy and he needed to destroy them.  There were nearly 4,000 pills/patches, in total.\n",
            "Third, SCHIRRIPA caused Medicare and Medicaid to be billed for these controlled substance prescriptions, and he falsely represented that these prescriptions were for patients of his pharmacy.  In fact, these prescriptions were not for patients of his pharmacy, and SCHIRRIPA himself possessed those prescriptions at his home on Long Island.  In connection with this scheme, SCHIRRIPA used the personal identifying information of his pharmacy’s patients, without their authorization.\n",
            "*                *                *\n",
            "SCHIRRIPA, 66, of Fort Salonga, New York, is charged with one count of violating the Defense Production Act, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison; two counts of making false statements, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of healthcare fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; and one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison, which must run consecutively to any other sentence of imprisonment.\n",
            "Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of HSI-NY, working in conjunction with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the DEA, the New York City Police Department, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Port Authority Police Department.  He also expressed gratitude to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, and the Northvale, New Jersey, Police Department.  He noted that the investigation is ongoing.\n",

            "Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Margaret Garnett, the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Investigation (“DOI”), announced the arrest of RONALD ROMANO for attempting to deceive and price gouge New York City (the “City”) into paying him and his co-conspirators approximately $45 million for personal protective equipment that ROMANO did not possess and was not authorized to sell.  ROMANO committed this scheme in an attempt to exploit NYC as it was trying to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and obtain these resources to help protect the lives of hospital and other frontline workers.  ROMANO is charged in a criminal Complaint, unsealed today, with one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud, one count of wire fraud, and one count of conspiring to violate the Defense Production Act.  ROMANO will be presented this afternoon in Manhattan federal court before U.S. Magistrate Judge Ona T. Wang.\n",
            "U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:  “As alleged, used car salesman Ronald Romano saw the current health emergency as an opportunity to cash in, using lies and deception in what he envisioned as a get-rich-quick scheme.  Romano allegedly lied repeatedly about his authority and ability to sell large quantities of personal protective equipment to the City – equipment he knew was desperately needed for use by frontline medical workers and first responders.  And he allegedly offered to sell this phantom equipment to the City at grossly inflated prices.  Now Ronald Romano’s short-lived second career as a purveyor of vital protective gear is over.”\n",
            "DOI Commissioner Margaret Garnett said:  “At a time when the pandemic was ravaging New York City, this defendant greedily preyed on the City’s desperate need for protective equipment to stop the spread of the virus. But, instead of reaping millions of dollars, the scheme received a dose of old-fashioned, New York City skepticism from procurement specialists at the City’s Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS), when the City called the supposed manufacturer to confirm the astronomical asking price. The defendant’s ruse unraveled, and these City workers proved that heroes have an array of titles. I thank the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York for its partnership on this important investigation, one that demonstrates there is no tolerance, at any time, in particular during this crisis, for individuals who seek to victimize this City by holding essential workers’ safety hostage to price-gouging and fraud.”\n",
            "According to the allegations in the Complaint unsealed in Manhattan federal court:[1]\n",
            "In approximately February 2020, ROMANO, a used car dealer, began attempting to obtain for resale large quantities of personal protective equipment (“PPE”), including N95 respirators.  In furtherance of the scheme, ROMANO, among other things, created a fictitious authorization letter in March 2020, which falsely represented that ROMANO’s company was authorized to sell millions of units of 3M-brand PPE.  Shortly thereafter, in mid-March 2020, brokers acting on ROMANO’s behalf approached New York City (the “City”), which at the time was in critical need of legitimate, potentially lifesaving PPE, including respirators, in order to supply frontline healthcare workers and first responders during the COVID-19 public health emergency.  During ensuing negotiations, ROMANO and others repeatedly made false and fraudulent representations regarding, among other things, their authority and ability to supply 3M-brand PPE manufactured in the United States, and their track record in other PPE deals.  In an effort to close a deal for seven million N95 respirators, ROMANO, among other things, submitted a false and misleading references document to the City, which, among other things, listed a PPE deal with the Florida Division of Emergency Management (the “FDEM”) that had never occurred and separately provided a co-conspirator as a reference.  ROMANO hoped to get profit quickly through the scheme.  As he described in a message to a co-conspirator, “I’m working on a few deals that if I get any of them you might be buying a Ferrari.” \n",
            "In furtherance of this scheme, ROMANO attempted to sell PPE at prices far above the prices at which he hoped to acquire the PPE, including after such PPE was designated as scarce materials under the Defense Production Act on March 25, 2020.  ROMANO offered three-ply N99 facemasks to FDEM at prices marked up by more than 500% from the manufacturer’s prices, and he separately offered the City millions of 3M-brand N95 respirators at more than a 400% markup from the list price for such respirators.\n",

            "Mr. Berman praised the Special Agents of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York for their outstanding investigative work, and thanked the New York City Department of Investigation for their invaluable assistance with this matter.  Mr. Berman also thanked the 3M Company for its assistance in the investigation.\n",

            "LOS ANGELES – The recently ousted head of Aviron Pictures was arrested this morning on federal fraud charges that allege he applied for $1.7 million in loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), falsely certified that the money would be used to finance the operations of other Aviron entities, and then used some of the relief funds for his personal expenses.\n",
            "         William Sadleir, 66, of Beverly Hills, was taken into custody without incident by special agents with the FBI, the Small Business Administration’s Office of Inspector General (SBA OIG), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG). Sadleir is expected to make his initial court appearance this afternoon in United States District Court in downtown Los Angeles.\n",
            "         Sadleir was arrested pursuant to a criminal complaint that accuses him of fraudulently filing bank loan applications that sought more than $1.7 million dollars in forgivable PPP loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Sadleir allegedly obtained the forgivable loans by falsely representing that the funds would be used to support payroll expenses, when, in fact, Sadleir intended to use and did use a significant portion of the funds for personal and non-business-related expenses\n",
            "         The complaint, which was filed Thursday and unsealed after his arrest today, charges Sadleir with wire fraud, bank fraud, making false statements to a financial institution, and making false statements to the Small Business Administration.\n",
            "         According to the affidavit in support of the complaint, Sadleir last month caused applications for PPP loans to be submitted to JPMorgan Chase on behalf of Aviron Group, LLC; Aviron Licensing, LLC; and Aviron Releasing, LLC dba Regatta. The bank approved the loans, and Sadleir received more than $1.7 million. “[I]mmediately upon receiving the funds a significant amount was diverted to Sadleir’s personal accounts and used for personal expenses,” the complaint alleges.\n",
            "         Sadleir was terminated from Aviron Pictures in late 2019, and people associated with the film production company told investigators that Sadleir currently had no role in Aviron Pictures or the related entities, according to the affidavit, which notes that Aviron Group, Aviron Licensing and Aviron Releasing are not engaged in any ongoing operations.\n",
            "         “This film producer allegedly made a series of misrepresentations to a bank and the Small Business Administration to illegally secure taxpayer money that he then used to fund his nearly empty personal bank account,” said United States Attorney Nick Hanna. “The Paycheck Protection Program was implemented to help small businesses stay afloat during the financial crisis, and we will act swiftly against those who abuse the program for their own personal gain.”\n",
            "         “This defendant allegedly used Paycheck Protection Program loans to pay off his personal credit card debts and other personal expenses, rather than using the funds for legitimate business needs,” said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “As the department has made clear, those who defraud the PPP to line their own pockets at the expense of the American people will be brought to justice.”\n",
            "         “These funds were designed to be a lifeline to businesses struggling to stay afloat during the current crisis,” said Paul Delacourt, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office. “The FBI is committed to maintaining the integrity of the PPP and will hold accountable those who cheat the system at the expense of American taxpayers.”\n",
            "         Authorities have linked Sadleir to the three PPP loan applications made on behalf of the three Aviron entities. All three applications claimed each company had 33 employees and monthly payroll expenses of well over $200,000. On April 30, JPMorgan Chase approved the loan applications, and the next day money was wired to nearly empty JPMorgan Chase bank accounts associated with the three entities.\n",
            "         Within days, nearly $1 million of the PPP loan money was transferred into Sadleir’s personal account at JPMorgan Chase, the affidavit alleges. Investigators have determined that some of this money was used to pay personal expenses, including payments to Sadleir’s and his wife’s American Express cards. One payment allegedly made with PPP loan proceeds – a $40,000 payment on Sadleir’s car loan – was reversed and JPChase Morgan froze the accounts associated with the alleged scheme.\n",

            "         “Today’s charges hold the defendant responsible for his alleged actions to swindle money out of a federal program intended to help those in need during a pandemic crisis,” said FDIC OIG Special Agent in Charge Wade V. Walters. “When an individual cheats the Paycheck Protection Program out of money, it deprives hard-working Americans and deserving small businesses. The FDIC OIG is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate financial crimes in order to preserve the integrity of the nation’s banking sector.”\n",

            "The Department of Justice today filed a statement of interest in an Illinois federal court in support of a lawsuit filed by Illinois state representative Darren Bailey challenging certain actions of Governor J.B. Pritzker in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            "The Statement of Interest is part of Attorney General William P. Barr’s April 27, 2020 initiative directing Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division, and the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, Matthew Schneider, to review state and local policies to ensure that civil liberties are protected during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",
            "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Governor of Illinois has, over the past two months, sought to rely on authority under the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act to impose sweeping limitations on nearly all aspects of life for citizens of Illinois, significantly impairing in some instances their ability to maintain their economic livelihoods.  According to the lawsuit, the Governor’s actions are not authorized by state law, as they extend beyond the 30-day time period imposed by the Illinois legislature for the Governor’s exercise of emergency powers granted under the Act. \n",
            "Representative Bailey brought his case in Illinois state court and elected only to assert state law claims.  On May 15, the presiding state court judge ordered Bailey to file his motion for summary judgment by May 18 and instructed the Governor to respond to it by May 21.  A hearing on the motion for summary judgment was scheduled to take place in state court today. Yesterday, however, instead of responding to Bailey’s motion for summary judgment, the Governor removed the case to federal district court. \n",
            "“The Governor of Illinois owes it to the people of Illinois to allow his state’s courts to adjudicate the question of whether Illinois law authorizes orders he issued to respond to COVID-19,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division.  “The United States Constitution and state constitutions established a system of divided and limited governmental power, and they did so to secure the blessings of liberty to all people in our country.  Under our system, all public officials, including governors, must comply with the law, especially during times of crisis.  The Department of Justice remains committed to defending  the rule of law and the American people at all times, especially during this difficult time as we deal with COVID-19 pandemic.”\n",
            "“However well-intentioned they may be, the executive orders appear to reach far beyond the scope of the 30-day emergency authority granted to the Governor under Illinois law,” said Steven D. Weinhoeft, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Illinois.  “Even during times of crisis, executive actions undertaken in the name of public safety must be lawful.  And while the people of Illinois must be physically protected from the effects of this public health crisis, including by complying with CDC guidelines their constitutionally guaranteed rights and liberties must be safeguarded as well.”  \n",
            "In its statement of interest, the United States explains that this dispute belongs in Illinois state court, and that Representative Bailey has raised substantial questions as to whether the Governor’s current response to COVID-19 is lawful.  Although the complaint does not raise any federal constitutional claims, the statement explains, “It is up to the Illinois courts to rule on Plaintiff’s claims, which, because of the sweeping nature of the Orders, may affect millions of lives and raise significant constitutional concerns in other litigation.”  Even in the face of a pandemic, states must comply with their own laws in making these sensitive policy choices in a manner responsive to the people and, in doing so, both respect and serve the goals of our broader federal structure, including the guarantee of due process in the U.S. Constitution. \n",
            "The federal case is Bailey v. Pritzker, No. 3:20-cv-474.\n",

            "The grants, to the City of Leesburg, Town of Stafford, James City County, City of Chesapeake, Henrico County, and Chesterfield County, are available under the Coronavirus Emergency Supplemental Funding program, authorized by the recent stimulus legislation signed by President Trump. The Justice Department is moving quickly, awarding grants on a rolling basis and aiming to have funds available for drawdown as soon as possible after receiving applications.\n",
            "“Those on the front lines of the public safety response to the coronavirus have our support, gratitude, and utmost respect,” said Terwilliger. “The Department of Justice provides this funding with significant flexibility, so that state and local departments can use it in the ways that best benefit their officers and their community.”\n",
            "The grants come on the heels of a separate DOJ grants of over $11 million to the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services, the City of Petersburg, the City of Alexandria, the County of Hanover, and the City of Suffolk announced earlier this month.\n",
            "“The outbreak of COVID-19 and the public health emergency it created are sobering reminders that even the most routine duties performed by our nation’s public safety officials carry potentially grave risks,” said Katharine T. Sullivan, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs. “These funds will provide hard-hit communities with critical resources to help mitigate the impact of this crisis and give added protection to the brave professionals charged with keeping citizens safe.”\n",

            "On May 3, the Department of Justice filed a Statement of Interest supporting Lighthouse Fellowship Church’s emergency request for an injunction pending appeal of the district court’s ruling of May 1, which denied Lighthouse Fellowship Church’s emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. Yesterday, the district court denied the church’s request for an injunction pending appeal. Lighthouse Fellowship Church previously appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit the district court’s denial of its emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The Department of Justice is assessing its options with regard to participating in that appeal.\n",
            "“Our First Amendment right to freely exercise religion does not disappear during a pandemic,” said Terwilliger. “Public safety is critical while COVID-19 remains with us, but we must also preserve our fundamental liberties.”\n",
            "“The First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right of all people in our country to exercise their religion freely and without undue restrictions imposed by government,” said Dreiband. “As President Trump again reminded us earlier today, houses of worship are essential to people of faith, and those people include the recovering drug addicts and former prostitutes who allege that the Commonwealth of Virginia is unlawfully denying their ability to exercise right religion.”\n",

If convicted, Curry faces up to 5 years in federal prison. Curry had been initially charged by criminal complaint on April 7, 2020.  \n",
            "According to court documents, on March 27, 2020, officers from the St. Petersburg Police Department responded to a domestic violence call involving Curry. During Curry’s arrest, he turned to an officer, declared that he was infected with the Coronavirus, and coughed on the officer’s arm. The following day, Curry bonded out of the Pinellas County Jail.\n",
            "On the evening of March 28, 2020, police were again called to the same residence where they had previously encountered Curry and arrested him a second time. During his arrest, Curry spit on an arresting officer multiple times—hitting the officer in the face, nose, and inside her mouth with blood-filled saliva. Curry again claimed to have the Coronavirus, laughed, and announced that he was spreading the virus around. Law enforcement subsequently obtained and executed a search warrant to test Curry for COVID-19. Curry tested negative. Individuals close to Curry and jail personnel reported that Curry had not shown any symptoms of COVID-19.\n",

            "Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, William F. Sweeney Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), Kevin Kupperbusch, Eastern Region Special Agent-in-Charge of the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”), and Jonathan D. Larsen, Special Agent in Charge of the New York Field Office of the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (“IRS-CI”), announced today the arrest of MUGE MA, a/k/a “Hummer Mars,” a Chinese national residing in Manhattan, for a fraudulent scheme to obtain over $20 million in Government-guaranteed loans designed to provide relief to small businesses during the novel coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic.  In connection with loan applications for relief available from the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL”) Program, MA falsely represented to the SBA and five financial institutions that his companies, New York International Capital LLC (“NYIC”) and Hurley Human Resources LLC (“Hurley”), had hundreds of employees and paid millions of dollars in wages to those employees, when, in fact, MA appears to have been the only employee of his companies.  MA’s company NYIC also fraudulently represented that it was representing New York State in procuring COVID-19 test kits and personal protective equipment to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.  MA was arrested this morning and will be presented later today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Kevin Nathaniel Fox.\n",
            "Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:  “Muge Ma, a/k/a ‘Hummer Mars,’ allegedly attempted to secure over $20 million in Government-guaranteed loans intended for businesses devastated by the coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic.  In furtherance of the scheme, Ma allegedly falsely represented in his applications to banks and the SBA to own two companies with hundreds of employees to whom he paid millions in wages.  As alleged, Ma described one of the companies as a ‘patriotic American’ firm, and said of the other company that it would ‘help the country reduce the high unemployment rate caused by the pandemic by helping unemployed American workers and unemployed American fresh graduates find jobs as quickly as possible.’  In truth, Ma appears to be the only employee of either company and had no legitimate claim to the funds for which he applied.  Ma’s alleged attempts to secure funds earmarked for legitimate small businesses in dire financial straits are as audacious as they are callous, and now he now faces federal prosecution.  Small businesses are facing uncertainty and unprecedented challenges, the least of which should be opportunists attempting to loot the federal funds meant to assist them.  This Office, along with our law enforcement partners, will continue to vigilantly protect the integrity of those critical loan programs.”\n",
            "FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr said:  “There are many people in desperate need of federal money right now to get them through an unbelievably difficult time. The last thing they need to hear is that a fraudster allegedly tried to steal millions of dollars for his own selfish use. We hope this serves as a demonstration to other criminals plotting a similar scam – we are acting and investigating in real time to stop anyone using this crisis as a means to rip off the federal government and the tax payers who fund that government.”\n",
            "SBA OIG Eastern Region Special Agent-in-Charge Kevin Kupperbusch said:  “Providing false statements to gain access to SBA’s programs will be aggressively investigated by our office.  SBA OIG and its law enforcement partners are poised to root out fraud in SBA’s programs and bring wrongdoers to justice.  I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”  \n",
            "IRS-CI Special Agent in Charge Jonathan D. Larsen said:  “As many American businesses are struggling to survive during these difficult times, it is alleged that Mr. Ma sought to steal millions of dollars in loans intended to assist legitimate businesses. Make no mistake about it, IRS-CI is committed to investigating and bringing to justice those individuals who defraud coronavirus relief programs.”\n",
            "According to the allegations contained in the Complaint[1] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court:\n",
            "The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of hundreds of billions of dollars in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the SBA’s PPP.  Pursuant to the CARES Act, the amount of PPP funds a business is eligible to receive is determined by the number of employees employed by the business and their average payroll costs.  Businesses applying for a PPP loan must provide documentation to confirm that they have previously paid employees the compensation represented in the loan application.  The CARES Act also expanded the separate EIDL Program, which provides small businesses with low-interest loans of up to $2 million that can provide vital economic support to help overcome the temporary loss of revenue they are experiencing due to COVID-19.  To qualify for an EIDL loan under the CARES Act, the applicant must have suffered “substantial economic injury” from COVID-19.\n",
            "From at least in or about March 2020 through at least on or about May 15, 2020, MA applied to the SBA and at least five banks for a total of over $20 million in Government-guaranteed loans for the his companies NYIC and Hurley (together, the “Ma Companies”) through the SBA’s PPP and EIDL Program.  In connection with these loan applications, MA represented, among other things, that he was the sole owner and executive director of the Ma Companies, that the Ma Companies were located on the sixth floor of his luxury condominium building in New York, New York, and that NYIC and Hurley together had hundreds of employees and paid millions of dollars in wages to those employees on a monthly basis.  In fact, however, MA appears to have been the only employee of NYIC since at least in or about 2019, and Hurley does not appear to have any employees.  In order to support the false representations made by MA in the loan applications about the number of employees at, and the wages paid by, the Ma Companies, MA submitted fraudulent and doctored bank records, tax records, insurance records, payroll records, and/or audited financial statements to five different banks, and also provided links to the Ma Companies’ websites, which describe them as purportedly “global” companies.  In the course of these loan applications, MA also misrepresented that he was a United States citizen, when, in fact, he is a Chinese national with lawful permanent resident status in the United States.\n",
            "Before the discovery of the fraudulent conduct by MA, the SBA approved a $500,000 EIDL Program loan for NYIC and a $150,000 EIDL Program loan for Hurley, and at least a $10,000 loan advance was provided to NYIC.  In addition, a bank approved and disbursed over approximately $800,000 in PPP loan funds for Hurley, which were frozen in connection with this investigation.  As a result, MA sought to withdraw his loan applications from the banks and return the funds.\n",
            "MA and individuals purporting to work for NYIC have also fraudulently represented to a COVID-19 test kit manufacturer and a medical equipment supplier that NYIC is representing the New York State Government and the Governor of New York in procuring COVID-19 test kits and personal protective equipment (“PPE”) to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Among other incidents, in a recorded call that took place on or about May 18, 2020, MA represented, in substance and in part, that his company NYIC was a registered vendor for New York State, among other state governments, and that NYIC had a big team working on a deal for the State.  NYIC is not, however, an authorized vendor of New York State, nor has NYIC been authorized to represent New York State in connection with the procurement of COVID-19 supplies.\n",
            "*                *                *\n",
            "MA, 36 of New York, New York, is charged with one count of bank fraud, one count of wire fraud, and one count of making false statements to a bank, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, one count of major fraud against the United States, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, one count of making false statements, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and one count of making false statements to the SBA, which carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison.  The maximum potential sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.\n",
            "Any businesses or individuals who believe they may have been a victim in this investigation or have information regarding this investigation should call the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Complaint Center at (855) 292-3937.\n",
            "Mr. Berman praised the investigative work of the FBI’s Financial Cybercrimes Task Force, SBA-OIG, and IRS-CI, and noted that the investigation remains ongoing.  Mr. Berman also thanked the New York City Police Department, the Office of the New York State Comptroller, and the New York State Department of Labor for their assistance with the investigation.\n",

            "PITTSBURGH - U.S. Attorney Scott W. Brady is asking anyone who has witnessed or experienced sexual harassment by a landlord, property manager, maintenance worker, or anyone with control over housing to report that conduct to the Department of Justice.\n",
            "The COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted the ability of many people to pay rent on time and has increased housing insecurity. The Department of Justice is investigating reports of housing providers trying to exploit the crisis to sexually harass tenants. Sexual harassment in housing is illegal, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania stands ready to investigate such allegations and pursue enforcement actions where appropriate.\n",
            "\"While many landlords are responding to these circumstances with understanding and care, trying to work with their tenants to weather the current crisis, others are responding to requests to defer rent payments with demands for sexual favors and other acts of unwelcome sexual misconduct,\" stated U.S. Attorney Brady. \"Such behavior is despicable, illegal, and will not be tolerated. Tenants should never have to choose between housing and sexual harassment.\"\n",
            "Launched in 2017, DOJ’s Sexual Harassment in Housing Initiative is an effort to combat sexual harassment in housing led by the Civil Rights Division, in coordination with U.S. Attorney’s Offices across the country. The goal of the Initiative is to address sexual harassment by landlords, property managers, maintenance workers, loan officers or other people who have control over housing.\n",
            "The Department of Justice enforces the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, and disability. Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Act. Many individuals do not know that being sexually harassed by a housing provider can violate federal law or that the Department of Justice may be able to help.\n",
            "U.S. Attorney Brady encourages anyone who has experienced sexual harassment by a landlord, or other person who has control over housing, resulting from the COVID-19 crisis, to contact the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania by calling (412) 644-3500 or emailing usapaw.civilrights@usdoj.gov.\n",

            "Samuel Yates, 32, of Maud, Texas, allegedly sought millions of dollars in forgivable loans guaranteed by the SBA from two different banks by claiming to have over 400 employees earning wages when, in fact, no employees worked for his purported business.\n",
            "Yates is charged by way of a federal criminal complaint with violations of wire fraud, bank fraud, false statements to a financial institution, and false statements to the SBA.\n",
            "“This defendant allegedly sought to steal millions of dollars in loans intended to aid legitimate small businesses grappling with the economic effects of COVID-19,” said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.  “The department and our law enforcement partners will use all the tools at our disposal to investigate and prosecute frauds against the Paycheck Protection Program.”\n",

            "According to court documents unsealed today in U.S. District Court in Texarkana, Yates allegedly made two fraudulent applications to two different lenders for loans guaranteed by the SBA for COVID-19 relief through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).  In the application submitted to the first lender, Yates allegedly sought $5 million in PPP loan proceeds by fraudulently claiming to have 400 employees with an average monthly payroll of $2 million.  In the second application, Yates claimed to employ over 100 individuals and was able to obtain a loan over $500,000. With each application, Yates submitted a list of purported employees that he obtained from a publicly available random name generator on the internet. He also submitted forged tax documents with each application.\n",

            "The PPP allows qualifying small-businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within eight weeks of receipt and use at least 75 percent of the forgiven amount for payroll. \n",

            "LOS ANGELES – During the coronavirus pandemic, the Justice Department is continuing its mission to detect, investigate and prosecute wrongdoing. United States Attorney Nick Hanna and FBI Assistant Director in Charge Paul Delacourt today stressed that a crucial part of this mission is ensuring that all citizens are free from harassment or discrimination because of their ethnicity.\n",
            "         “Federal law enforcement is dedicated to working with our colleagues on the state level and the entire community we serve to prevent acts of bias, especially violent acts or threats,” Mr. Hanna said. “Everyone in the United States has felt the effects of the ongoing emergency, and we want to ensure that no one suffers further disruption due to fear, prejudice or xenophobia.”\n",
            "         “While we are made up of many ethnicities and backgrounds in this country, particularly in a multi-cultural city like Los Angeles, we must always be cognizant that we are all Americans and must respect the fundamental civil rights which unite us,” said Mr. Delacourt, who is in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office. “The FBI is concerned about the potential for hate crimes by individuals and groups targeting minority populations whom they wrongly believe are responsible for the spread of the virus. While the FBI routinely reaches out to community organizations in the areas we serve, we want to reach the community directly by asking anyone who has been victimized by a crime inspired by hatred or discrimination to contact their nearest FBI office to make a report.”\n",
            "         There is a significant disparity between hate crimes that actually occur and those reported to law enforcement. It is critical to report hate crimes not only to show support for the people directly impacted, but also to send a clear message that the community will not tolerate these kinds of crimes. Reporting also enables law enforcement to fully understand the scope of the problem in a community and assign resources toward preventing and addressing crimes of bias and hate.\n",
            "         Members of the public are encouraged to report crimes motivated by bias or hate to law enforcement. If you or someone you know are in immediate danger, call 911. If you believe you have been the target or victim of a hate crime or other violation of your civil rights, please contact your local FBI field office. You may reach the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office 24 hours a day at (310) 477-6565 or you may submit an online tip at https://www.fbi.gov/tips.\n",

The United States Attorney’s Office and the FBI have dedicated civil rights units that vigorously investigate and prosecute allegations of hate crimes against victims targeted because of their race or ethnicity.\n",

            "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma entered the temporary restraining order on May 14, 2020 in response to a civil complaint and accompanying court papers filed by the Department of Justice.  In its complaint, the department alleges that Xephyr LLC, doing business as N-Ergetics, and its owners Brad Brand, Derill J. Fussell, and Linda Fussell, sell and distribute a colloidal silver product claiming that it will cure, mitigate, or treat coronavirus and its resulting disease, COVID-19, as well as other diseases including pneumonia, AIDS, and cancer.  Colloidal silver is a suspension of silver particles in a liquid, and it is not generally recognized as safe and effective by qualified experts for any of the uses for which defendants promote it.\n",

            "The department’s complaint alleges that defendants are introducing unapproved new drugs into interstate commerce and that their disease-related treatment claims are unsupported by any well-controlled clinical studies or other credible scientific substantiation.  Additionally, the complaint asserts that, because defendants’ products do not have adequate directions for lay users, the products are misbranded. \n",
            "On March 6, 2020, FDA, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission, issued a Warning Letter to defendants notifying them that they are violating federal law (including the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) by, among other things, distributing unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs in interstate commerce.  After receipt of this warning, the complaint alleges, the defendants attempted to cloak their claims to prevent liability, while continuing to make the same substantive claims and to sell colloidal silver as a cure, mitigation, or treatment for coronavirus and COVID-19.\n",
            "“Xephyr’s claims that their unapproved colloidal silver products can cure, mitigate, prevent, or treat COVID-19, or other diseases like cholera, diabetes, cancer, and AIDS, will not be tolerated.  Americans expect and deserve medical treatments that have been scientifically proven to be safe and effective, especially during this ongoing pandemic,” said Stacy Amin, FDA Chief Counsel.  “The FDA will continue our efforts to make sure that this and other like-minded sellers comply with the law.”\n",

Lyons of the Department of Justice, Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael O’Malley of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, with assistance from Associate Chief Counsel for Enforcement Jaclyn Martínez Resly of the FDA, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Health and Human Services.\n",
            "The claims made in the complaint are allegations that, if the case were to proceed to trial, the government must prove to receive a permanent injunction against the defendants.  \n",
            "In response to the department’s filing, defendants immediately took down their sales site.  In addition, they have posted a message offering refunds to their customers:  “Due to the FDA and the DOJ’s requests, this site has been removed.  Anyone who has ordered in the last 90 days, and would like a refund, please email...”  The department will continue to seek complete relief against defendants.\n",

            "Press Release:\n",
            "A Georgia woman was arrested today for her alleged role in a conspiracy to defraud Medicare, a federally funded health care benefit program, by submitting false and fraudulent claims for cancer genetic (CGX) testing, as well as her role in conspiring to submit fraudulent claims related to COVID-19 and other tests.\n",
            "Ashley Hoobler Parris, aka Ashley Hoobler and Ashley Parris, 32, of Lawrenceville, Georgia, is charged by complaint with conspiring to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute and conspiring to commit health care fraud.  Hoobler was arrested this morning and is scheduled to have her initial court appearance this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Justin S. Anand of the Northern District of Georgia.\n",
            "“The defendant allegedly sought to pay and receive illegal kickbacks in exchange for referring Medicare beneficiaries for expensive genetic screening tests and COVID-19 tests,” said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.  “The department will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to protect the public from those who defraud our government health care programs, especially those who exploit the COVID-19 pandemic for personal gain.”\n",
            "“Fraud related to COVID-19 is particularly disturbing as it exploits a national crisis for personal gain,” said U.S. Attorney Maria Chapa Lopez of the Middle District of Florida.  “The U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners remain focused on investigating and prosecuting individuals seeking to defraud federal government programs for personal profit,  especially during this pandemic.”\n",
            "“Let this arrest be a warning that our agents remain vigilant in our fight against healthcare fraud and improper billing of federal healthcare programs,” said Omar Pérez Aybar, Special Agent in Charge for the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  “With our law enforcement partners, we will continue to hold accountable those who attempt to enrich themselves at the government’s expense.”\n",
            "The complaint alleges that, starting in or around October of 2018, and continuing through the present, Hoobler solicited and received illegal kickback payments from the owners and operators of a diagnostic testing laboratory in exchange for referring Medicare beneficiaries to this laboratory.  The complaint further alleges that the owners and operators of the laboratory then submitted claims to Medicare for cancer genetic testing for the beneficiaries referred by Hoobler that were not eligible for reimbursement. The laboratory paid Hoobler a percentage of the paid claims as kickbacks.\n",
            "Initially, the scheme related to Hoobler’s receipt of kickbacks for submitting CGX tests to diagnostic testing facilities.  CGX testing is a type of test that uses DNA sequencing to detect mutations in genes that could indicate a higher risk of developing certain types of cancers in the future.  CGX testing is not a method of diagnosing whether an individual presently has cancer.  Generally, in order to have CGX tests conducted, an individual must complete a buccal or nasopharyngeal swab, or a respiratory sample, to collect a specimen, which specimen can then be transmitted to a laboratory for testing.  Medicare rules and regulations provide that CGX testing is only reimbursable under certain specific circumstances, and tests not ordered by the physician who is treating the Medicare beneficiary are not considered reasonable and necessary.\n",
            "The complaint alleges that Hoobler and her co-conspirators would obtain Medicare patient information and swabs by having Medicare beneficiaries complete genetic test kits, without regard to their medical necessity.  Hoobler and her co-conspirators would obtain doctors’ orders for CGX testing for those beneficiaries by paying illegal kickbacks to co-conspirators at telemedicine companies.  Hoobler also received illegal kickbacks in exchange for sending the completed CGX swabs and doctors’ orders to a laboratory.  The laboratory would then submit false and fraudulent claims to Medicare.\n",
            "Starting in or around February 2020, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic began to be felt in the United States.  According to the allegations in the complaint, as the COVID-19 crisis began to escalate, certain laboratory owners and operators have been willing to pay illegal kickbacks in exchange for completed COVID-19 and Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) tests, which reimburse at a much higher rate than the COVID-19 tests.\n",
            "The complaint further alleges that Hoobler agreed with others to be paid kickbacks on a per-test basis for COVID-19 tests, provided that those tests were bundled with more expensive RPP tests.  Medicare’s reimbursement rates for the RPP tests are approximately four times higher than the reimbursement rates for the COVID-19 test.\n",
            "HHS-OIG’s Miami Regional Office investigated the case with assistance from the Atlanta Regional Office and was brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, under the supervision of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida.  Trial Attorney Alejandro J. Salicrup is prosecuting the case. \n",
            "A complaint is merely an allegation, and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n",
            "The Fraud Section leads the Medicare Fraud Strike Force.  Since its inception in March 2007, the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, which maintains 15 strike forces operating in 24 districts, has charged more than 4,200 defendants who have collectively billed the Medicare program for nearly $19 billion.  In addition, the HHS Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, working in conjunction with the HHS-OIG, are taking steps to increase accountability and decrease the presence of fraudulent providers.\n",

            "An engineer has been charged in the Eastern District of Texas with allegedly filing bank loan applications fraudulently seeking more than $10 million dollars in forgivable loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. \n",
            "Shashank Rai, 30, of Beaumont, Texas, allegedly sought millions of dollars in forgivable loans guaranteed by the SBA from two different banks by claiming to have 250 employees earning wages when, in fact, no employees worked for his purported business.\n",
            "Rai is charged by way of a federal criminal complaint with violations of wire fraud, bank fraud, false statements to a financial institution, and false statements to the SBA.\n",
            "“As alleged, Rai fraudulently pursued millions of dollars in loans intended for legitimate small businesses suffering the economic hardships of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.  “The department and our law enforcement partners will remain vigilant in our efforts to protect critical CARES Act relief programs from fraud and abuse.”\n",
            "“The behavior in this case was very brazen,” said U.S. Attorney Joseph D. Brown of the Eastern District of Texas.  “Those who submit these applications for loans or other assistance need to understand that there are people checking on the representations made, and those representations are made under oath and subject to the penalties of perjury. Federal agencies are watching for fraud, and people who lie and try to cheat the system are going to be caught and prosecuted.”\n",
            "“To support small and community banks, the Federal Home Loan Banks can accept Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans as collateral when making loans to their members,” said Richard Parker, Acting Deputy Inspector General for Investigations for the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General.  “The Office of Inspector General is proud to work with our partners in law enforcement to prevent, detect, and deter attempts to perpetrate fraud in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and steal the assistance intended for small business owners and employees under this important part of the CARES Act.”\n",

Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG).  “When an individual cheats the Paycheck Protection Program out of money, it deprives hard-working Americans and deserving small businesses.  The FDIC OIG is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate financial crimes in order to preserve the integrity of the nation’s banking sector.”\n",
            "“SBA OIG and its law enforcement partners will aggressively investigate fraud in the Paycheck Protection Program,” said SBA Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware.  “The nation’s small businesses are counting on this program, and we will safeguard it to maintain the public trust.  I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”\n",

The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is committed to protecting small business owners, and the American public, from those who seek to do financial harm.”\n",
            "According to court documents unsealed today in U.S. District Court in Beaumont, Rai allegedly made two fraudulent claims to two different lenders for seek loans guaranteed by the SBA for COVID-19 relief through the PPP.  In the application submitted to the first lender, Rai allegedly sought $10 million in PPP loan proceeds by fraudulently claiming to have 250 employees with an average monthly payroll of $4 million.  In the second application, Rai allegedly sought approximately $3 million in PPP loan proceeds by fraudulently claiming to have 250 employees with an average monthly payroll of approximately $1.2 million.\n",
            "According to court documents, the Texas Workforce Commission provided information to investigators of having no records of employee wages having been paid in 2020 by Rai or his purported business, Rai Family LLC. In addition, the Texas Comptroller’s Office of Public Accounts reported to investigators that Rai Family LLC reported no revenues for the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020.\n",

            "The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.\n",
            "The PPP allows qualifying small-businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within eight weeks of receipt and use at least 75 percent of the forgiven amount for payroll. \n",

            "CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Government officials issued a warning today, to alert the public about potential fraud schemes related to economic stimulus programs offered by the U.S. Small Business Administration to assist small business owners during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            "Andrew Murray, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, John A. Strong, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in North Carolina, and Kevin Kupperbusch, Special Agent in Charge of the Small Business Administration, Office of the Inspector General (SBA-OIG), Eastern Region, made the announcement today.\n",
            "“During these unprecedented times, when small business owners impacted by COVID-19 are doing their best to keep their businesses afloat, it is easy to fall prey to scammers. We advise everyone to remain vigilant in safeguarding their personal and their business information, and to be particularly discerning of emails or other solicitations related to economic relief programs.  As always, we are working in coordination with our law enforcement partners to identify fraudulent schemes and to bring scammers to justice, but the best first line of defense is for the public to exercise extreme caution before divulging important information to those who may be using economic relief programs as an opportunity to commit fraud,” said U.S. Attorney Andrew Murray.\n",
            "“While American small business owners and employees are struggling, fraudsters are busy trying to steal the money meant to help those families survive. With billions of dollars in aid available, they will try every trick in the book to rob the rightful recipients of those funds. The FBI along with our partners are working every day to keep Americans safe during this unprecedented time. We want to remind everyone to go to official sites for information and never trust a text, email, or phone call promising a deal that sounds too good to be true,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge John Strong.    \n",
            "“Fraudsters prey upon those in vulnerable positions, and this is a critical time for our nation’s small businesses,” said SBA OIG Special Agent in Charge Kevin Kupperbusch.  “SBA OIG and its law enforcement partners are actively working together to root out fraud in SBA’s programs and bring those responsible to justice.  The public is encouraged to learn about potential fraud schemes and scams as a safeguard to being victimized.”\n",
            "The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), is the largest financial assistance bill to date, and includes provisions to help small businesses.  The public is warned to be extra vigilant in protecting their information and to be on the lookout for grant fraud, loan fraud, and phishing, as scammers are targeting small business owners during these economically difficult times. \n",
            "To raise awareness, the SBA’s Office of Inspector General has published the following information pertaining to possible scams and emerging fraud schemes: \n",
            "\n",
            "The SBA does not initiate contact on either 7a or disaster loans or grants.  If you are proactively contacted by someone claiming to be from the SBA, suspect fraud. \n",
            "If you are contacted by someone promising to get approval of an SBA loan, but requires any payment up front or offers a high interest bridge loan in the interim, suspect fraud.\n",
            "The SBA limits the fees a broker can charge a borrower to 3% for loans $50,000 or less and 2% for loans $50,000 to $1,000,000 with an additional ¼% on amounts over $1,000,000.  Any attempt to charge more than these fees is inappropriate.\n",
            "Look out for phishing attacks/scams utilizing the SBA logo.  These may be attempts to obtain your personally identifiable information (PII), to obtain personal banking access, or to install ransomware/malware on your computer.\n",
            "If you are in the process of applying for an SBA loan and receive email correspondence asking for PII, ensure that the referenced application number is consistent with the actual application number.\n",
            "Any email communication from SBA will come from accounts ending with sba.gov.\n",
            "The presence of an SBA logo on a webpage does not guarantee the information is accurate or endorsed by SBA.  Please cross-reference any information you receive with information available at www.sba.gov.\n",

            "If you have a question about getting an SBA disaster loan, call 800-659-2955 or send an email to disastercustomerservice@sba.gov.  If you have questions about other SBA lending products, call SBA’s Answer Desk at 800-827-5722 or send an email to answerdesk@sba.gov.

            "Maurice Fayne, aka Arkansas Mo, 37, of Dacula, Georgia, was charged with bank fraud and made his initial appearance this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Justin S. Anand. \n",
            "“The defendant allegedly stole money meant to assist hard-hit employees and businesses during these difficult times, and instead greedily used the money to bankroll his lavish purchases of jewelry and other personal items,” said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.  “The department will remain steadfast in our efforts to root out and prosecute frauds against the Paycheck Protection Program.”\n",
            "“The defendant allegedly took advantage of the emergency lending provisions of the Paycheck Protection Program that were intended to assist employees and small businesses battered by the Coronavirus,” said U.S. Attorney Byung J. “BJay” Pak of the Northern District of Georgia.  “We will investigate and charge anyone who inappropriately diverts these critical funds for their own personal gain.”\n",

            "According to the charges and other information presented in court, Fayne is the sole owner of a Georgia corporation called Flame Trucking.  On April 15, 2020, Fayne signed and submitted to United Community Bank (UCB) a PPP loan application in the name of Flame Trucking stating that the business had 107 employees and an average monthly payroll of $1,490,200.  In seeking a loan in the amount of $3,725,500, Fayne certified that the loan proceeds would be used to “retain workers and maintain payroll or make mortgage interest payments, lease payments, and utility payments, as specified under the Paycheck Protection Program Rule.”\n",
            "UCB ultimately funded the loan for $2,045,800.  Within days, Fayne allegedly used more than $1.5 million of the PPP loan proceeds to purchase $85,000 in jewelry, including a Rolex Presidential watch, a diamond bracelet, a 5.73 carat diamond ring for himself, and to pay $40,000 for child support.  Such payments are not an authorized use of PPP funds under the CARES Act.\n",
            "On May 6, 2020, Fayne was interviewed by federal agents and admitted that he submitted a PPP loan application on behalf of Flame Trucking.  Fayne claimed that he used all of the PPP loan proceeds to pay payroll and other business expenses incurred by Flame Trucking and denied using any of the PPP loan proceeds to pay his personal debts and expenses.           \n",
            "On May 11, 2020, agents executed a search at Fayne’s residence in Dacula and seized approximately $80,000 in cash, including $9,400 that Fayne had in his pockets, and the jewelry he purchased with the PPP funds, and further discovered a 2019 Rolls-Royce Wraith, which still had a temporary dealer tag on it.  Agents also executed seizure warrants for three bank accounts that Fayne owned or controlled and seized approximately $503,000 in PPP funds.\n",

            "PORTLAND, Ore.—U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams announced today that a Gresham, Oregon man has been charged with illegally purchasing, importing, and offering for sale chloroquine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in prescription drugs used to treat malaria.\n",
            "Matthew Owens, 42, has been charged by criminal complaint with smuggling and the receipt in interstate commerce of misbranded drugs and the delivery thereof for pay.\n",
            "“Together, Americans are facing a public health emergency without precedent in our lifetimes. We are heartened by the countless examples of public service by front-line health workers, law enforcement, and ordinary Americans alike. These heroic acts of service inspire us all,” said U.S. Attorney Williams. “And yet, there are some individuals actively trying to profit off the pandemic, and, in the process, putting more lives as risk. We will not let these selfish and dangerous criminal acts continue unchecked.”\n",
            "“Drugs that are produced and distributed outside the FDA’s oversight present the prospect of harm to the public health. The FDA’s drug approval process is designed to ensure that patients receive safe and effective drugs,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) Los Angeles Field Office. “The FDA will not tolerate those who attempt to place the public health at risk, especially during a pandemic and we will take appropriate action to protect consumers from bad actors who take advantage of a crisis to deceive the public.”\n",
            "“It’s unconscionable that individuals would prioritize their own greed over the health of others, particularly during a public health crisis,” said Eben Roberts, Acting Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Seattle. “Illicit distribution of narcotics put unsuspecting consumers at serious risk. HSI, and our law enforcement partners, will continue to seek and bring to justice anyone who attempts to use the current health emergency to exploit others.”\n",
            "According to court documents, on April 13, 2020, HSI contacted FDA-OCI after a package containing 122.8 grams of a white powder was intercepted at a FedEx facility in Memphis, Tennessee. The package originated in Xiaoshan, China, and was addressed to Owens’ Gresham apartment. The enclosed substance was declared as ammonium polyphosphate but was later determined to be chloroquine. An invoice included with the substance described it as a “sample” having “no commercial value”, statements commonly used by persons improperly importing items and attempting to avoid detection.\n",
            "Investigators searched FDA records and found neither “Hangzhou Weishi Electronic Commerce Co Ltd,” the entity who shipped the package, nor “Matthew Owens” as having registered any drug manufacturing facilities. A search of Oregon Medical Board, Oregon Board of Pharmacy, and Oregon State Board of Nursing public databases found no records indicating that Owens was a physician, pharmacist, or registered nurse.\n",
            "As the investigation continued, special agents from FDA-OCI and HSI learned that two additional shipments were sent from China to Owens’ apartment. One contained resveratrol, a chemical commonly found in dietary supplements. The second contained polyacrylamide, a chemical compound primarily used in wastewater treatment, but also as an ingredient in certain cosmetics.\n",
            "On April 27, 2020, agents from HSI, FDA-OCI, FBI, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) executed a search at Owens’ apartment. They seized laptop computers, cell phones, an unopened bag of clear, empty capsules for encapsulating pharmaceuticals, a foil bag containing an unknown powder, and a material safety data sheet for polyacrylamide.\n",
            "A forensic search of Owens’ cell phones and Facebook Messenger messages associated with his cell phone number revealed conversations discussing the purchase and receipt of chloroquine from Alibaba.com, the world’s largest online business-to-business trading platform. Other messages discussed the offering of chloroquine for sale as a treatment for COVID-19.\n",
            "Owens made his first appearance in federal court today after having been served a summons to appear on May 8, 2020. If convicted, Owens faces a maximum sentence of 23 years in federal prison, 3 years’ supervised release, and a $500,000 fine.\n",
            "A criminal complaint is only an accusation of a crime, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n",
            "This case was investigated by the FDA-OCI and HSI with assistance from the FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS). It is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Oregon.\n",
            "On March 27, 2020, the FDA issued a public notice warning of the dangers of using chloroquine phosphate and warning the public to be wary of anyone claiming to have a product to prevent or cure COVID-19. The U.S. Attorney’s Office joins the FDA in imploring the public not to take any form of chloroquine unless it has been prescribed by a licensed healthcare provider and is obtained through a legitimate source.\n",

            "Date: 5/09/2020\n",
            "Link: https://www.justice.gov/usao-mn/pr/op-ed-us-attorney-erica-macdonald-warns-potential-heightened-risk-child-exploitation-due\n",
            "Press Release:\n",
            "In an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, schools across Minnesota have switched to distance learning for the time being. As a result, children of all ages have access to and are using electronic devices at an unprecedented rate. This dramatic increase in time our children spend online creates a target rich environment for child predators who use various online methods to sexually exploit our children.\n",
            "The sexual exploitation and abuse of a child is a despicable crime affecting some of the most vulnerable members of our community. No child should ever have to suffer the pain of such vile acts. Regrettably, the ever growing use of technology has provided child predators with more tools and opportunities than ever to perpetrate their insidious crimes.\n",
            "The online sexual exploitation of children is a massive problem. During March 2020, the onset of new distance learning methods driven by COVID-19, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children received 2,027,520 reports of online child sexual exploitation, a 106 percent increase over March 2019. This is not just a national problem. It is a problem right here in Minnesota. In 2019, my office received a 43 percent increase in the number of online child exploitation case referrals over 2018. Thus far, our 2020 numbers remain equally and disturbingly high.\n",
            "There is no specific profile for victims; rather, children across all demographics can be targeted. The only commonality is youth, as the average age of a victim is only fifteen years old.\n",
            "This type of crime causes very real harm and has a lasting impact, especially on young victims. Images and videos do not easily disappear from the Internet and the long-term effects on victims and their families can be devastating.\n",
            "There is also one commonality among predators:  their willingness to target some of the most vulnerable members of our society to satisfy their prurient interests. Predators seek to take advantage of the trusting nature of young people and to prey on their youth and the vulnerability that comes with growing up. They set up fake profiles on social medial apps, gaming sites and other social networking tools. They scour social media to find children willing to befriend someone they do not know. They falsely represent themselves as someone else, such as a famous person, a new kid in town, a friend of a friend, another high school student and even modeling agents. They then cultivate an online relationship with their victims, building trust to solicit the sexually explicit images. This can happen quickly. In one case, it took only thirty minutes from the time the predator met the child on Facebook messenger to when the minor victim was producing sexually explicit images and videos for the perpetrator to exploit.\n",
            "I write today to raise our collective awareness of this issue as we all adjust to the rhythms of life during COVID-19. This type of exploitation thrives in secret. The more we talk about it the more effective we are at combatting these heinous crimes.\n",
            "With the fact that children are spending more time online comes the need for vigilance regarding our children’s online social interaction. The threat from online child predators is both real and unobtrusive but can be mitigated by teaching our children how to use the internet safely and responsibly and by monitoring their use as appropriate for their age.\n",
            "Preventing children from becoming victims is an important priority for federal law enforcement officials in Minnesota. In my office, we have a team of prosecutors who are specially trained to investigate and prosecute online child exploitation cases and work with law enforcement not only solve these crimes but to provide education and training to prevent the crimes from occurring. FBI Special Agent in Charge Rainer Drohshagen and I penned a joint letter to the Minnesota Department of Education explaining the heightened risk of online exploitation due to kids’ increased online presence and emphasizing the need for vigilance.\n",
            "I encourage parents, grandparents, siblings, teachers, and all caregivers to review the library of resources deployed by our partners at the FBI regarding child exploitation and other crimes related to COVID-19 at https://www.fbi.gov/coronavirus. Additional resources and data are available from NCMEC at www.missingkids.org.\n",
            "The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota has engaged and continues to engage parents, teachers, community leaders and law enforcement on this issue to offer practical resources, tips and case examples, and we will continue to do so. Now more than ever, however, we need everyone to join us in the fight for our children’s safety. This is an issue that cannot be spoken about enough. The predators are relentless; therefore, we too must be relentless. Look for red flags, talk to your children, and know where to report.\n",

            "\n",
            "PITTSBURGH - A New York resident was arrested and criminally charged for his role in allegedly advertising and selling stolen COVID-19 testing services for $135 to $200, falsely claiming that he was connected to labs that would test the kits, shipping test kits without any prior medical screening, and providing no results to consumers, United States Attorney Scott W. Brady announced today. Additionally, the United States Secret Service, Pittsburgh Field Office Cyber Fraud Task Force, successfully shut down the websites that advertised and sold these stolen test kits. The Department of Justice, under Attorney General William Barr’s recent direction, prioritizes such detection, investigation, disruption and prosecution of illegal conduct related to the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
            "Henry Sylvain Gindt II, 34, of Queens (New York), New York, has been charged by criminal complaint with committing mail fraud and wire fraud, and conspiring to commit mail fraud and wire fraud.\n",
            "\"Let this be a message to anyone who wants to scam our fellow citizens during this pandemic: the Department of Justice will take swift action to disrupt your scheme and then we will arrest you,\" said U.S. Attorney Brady. \"This is why we created our Western Pennsylvania COVID-19 Fraud Task Force. Gindt tried to profit from the pandemic by selling stolen test kits and services without ever delivering the promised results. Instead, we shut him down and now he is facing prison time.\"\n",
            "\"This case demonstrates the investigative capabilities of the United State Secret Service, as well as the members of the Western Pennsylvania COVID-19 Fraud Task Force under the leadership of U.S. Attorney Scott Brady. The suspect in this case took advantage of American citizens for his own personal benefit, preying on customers fear and anxiety,\" said Tim Burke, Special Agent in Charge, United States Secret Service, Pittsburgh Field Office. \"This case should serve as a strong deterrent for criminal actors considering taking part in related fraud schemes. The Secret Service along with our Western Pennsylvania COVID-19 Fraud Task Force partners will continue to investigate and arrest criminals who attempt to defraud citizens and businesses related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n",
            "According to the Criminal Complaint, Gindt II founded YouHealth, Inc., a website offering telemedicine and personalized nutrition, wellness and DNA genetics testing. Gindt II illegally obtained stolen COVID-19 test kits from a laboratory employee. He then advertised those stolen testing kit services for $135 to $200 on his YouHealth websites and in unsolicited emails that he sent to consumers in multiple states. As part of his advertising, Gindt II falsely and fraudulently misrepresented that he was affiliated with a certified lab that would test the samples and provide results. Gindt II sold the test kits to consumers – including in Western Pennsylvania – without any prior medical screening. Instead, once the testing kit services (including the nasal swabs used for collection and packaging to send to the lab) were ordered, Gindt would have them overnighted to consumers with a request to then complete a medical questionnaire to screen for COVID-19 symptoms. Gindt II sent the test kits to consumers via FedEx Overnight using the FedEx account in the name of an entity identified in the complaint as \"Lab\" and an individual identified as \"T. A.\" Gindt II directed consumers to swab themselves and send their test kits to \"Lab\" for testing. The consumers never received any test results.\n",
            "On April 15, 2020, the United States Secret Service, Pittsburgh Field Office Cyber Fraud Task Force, successfully shut down the websites for YouHealth.shop and YouHealth.me relating to this investigation.\n",
            "This case began following a tip to the Western Pennsylvania COVID-19 Task Force from a western Pennsylvania resident who had received an email from henry.gindt@youhealth.me advertising the sale of at-home COVID19 testing services.\n",
            "The public is urged to continue to report suspected fraud schemes related to COVID-19 by calling the Western Pennsylvania COVID-19 Fraud Task Force’s Toll Free Hotline: 1-888-C19-WDPA or 1-888-219-9372 or send an email to the Western Pennsylvania COVID-19 Fraud Task Force’s email address: usapaw.covid19@usdoj.gov. \n",

            "Press Release:\n",
            "Miami, Fl. – Top federal law enforcement officials in South Florida urge parents to stay alert to the increased danger their children face from on-line predators during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            "“A parent is a child’s best defense against on-line sex predators,” said Ariana Fajardo Orshan, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. “Now that our children are home and spending more time on the internet due to the health crisis, I encourage parents to engage in open and frank discussions with their children on who, and what, to avoid on-line.” \n",
            "“With children spending more time on the internet, it is especially important that they do so safely,” said George L. Piro, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Miami.  “Criminals and predators will try to develop a relationship with a young online victim, then arrange a meet to abuse the child or coerce a child into producing sexually explicit images through manipulations, gifts or threats, a crime called sextortion.  Parents and guardians should set guidelines and monitor their children’s internet use and, of course, immediately report any inappropriate contact between an adult and your child to law enforcement.”\n",
            "“Thousands of children right in South Florida are experiencing greater internet usage, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted traditional classroom settings to virtual instruction.  Increased presence online means children are at an even greater risk of encountering cyber predators who know how to exploit their vulnerabilities,” said Anthony Salisbury, Special Agent in Charge, Homeland Security Investigations (HIS), Miami. “With families staying home, many children will spend even more time using social media, gaming platforms and other online applications than usual. Now is as good a time as any to ensure kids and parents are practicing online safety and know how to identify potential threats.”\n",
            "To help parents navigate the increased threat during the pandemic that is keeping children indoors and on-line, U.S. Attorney Fajardo Orshan, FBI Special Agent in Charge Piro, and HSI Special Agent in Charge Salisbury recommend that parents do the following:  \n",
            "\n",
            "Tell your children to avoid communicating with strangers online.\n",
            "Monitor your children’s chats, messages, and communications with people, particularly through gaming systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Explain to your children that sometimes predators will offer them gifts in exchange for their taking and sending sexually explicit images or videos. Sometimes, the predators will make threats. Parents should explain to their children that these are strategies abusers use to get what they want, and if this happens, to not feel guilty and immediately tell a parent or other adult.\n",
            "To the extent possible, educate yourself about the internet tools your children use.  For example, set up your child’s specific profile on phones, iPads, and computer devices to limit the websites and content your child can access, and have a weekly “usage” sheet sent to you for that profile.  Make sure your children use privacy settings to restrict access to their online profiles.\n",
            "Check your children’s social media and gaming profiles and posts. Talk to your children about what is appropriate to say or share.\n",
            "Explain to your children that once images or comments post online, people can share them. Explain that everyone in the world can see what they publicly post on the internet and they can never completely erase posted images and comments.\n",
            "Encourage children to choose appropriate screen names and create strong passwords.  Parents should be aware of all passwords and discourage children from keeping their passwords a secret.\n",
            "Make it a rule with your children that they cannot arrange to meet up with someone they have met online without your knowledge and supervision. \n",
            "\t \n",
            "\n",
            "Child Exploitation is a serious federal crime, carrying severe federal penalties.

            "New Haven – United States Attorney John H. Durham, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, Chief State’s Attorney Richard Colangelo and FBI Special Agent in Charge David Sundberg today announced formation of a joint federal-state task force combatting COVID-19 related fraud in Connecticut.  The task force will investigate and prosecute a wide range of misconduct related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including price gouging, healthcare and government program fraud, consumer and small business scams, lending scams, charities fraud, and cyber fraud.  Violators may be subject to civil fines and penalties and/or state or federal criminal prosecution.\n",
            "“The Justice Department is prioritizing the investigation and prosecution of COVID-19 fraud schemes and individuals who are exploiting this public health crisis for personal gain,” said U.S. Attorney Durham.  “Our office has a dedicated COVID-19 Fraud Coordinator who is working closely with our state counterparts in the offices of the Attorney General and Chief State’s Attorney to review complaints and direct the prosecution of COVID-19-related crimes.  Working together, we will disrupt these schemes and are prepared to prosecute those who seek to prey upon people’s fears or sympathy and illegally profit from this pandemic.” \n",
            "“To those who seek to use this crisis as an opportunity to cheat, scam and defraud—stop. The Office of the Attorney General is working hand in hand with our state and federal enforcement partners to aggressively investigate and prosecute COVID-19 related misconduct. Our office has received over a thousand complaints regarding price gouging, scams and other schemes and our attorneys and investigators are following up on each and every one. If you are aware of COVID-19 related fraud and abuse, we want to know about it,” said Attorney General Tong.\n",
            "“We at the FBI are fully committed to this multi-agency Task Force and pledge our resources to combatting those attempting to take advantage of Connecticut residents during this vulnerable time,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Sundberg\n",
            "The COVID-19 Fraud Task Force highlighted key areas of concern:\n",
            "Stimulus Check Scams: The Task Force is warning residents to be cautious of scams involving COVID-19 federal stimulus checks. The federal government will never charge fees or ask you to pay money to receive your check. The federal government will never call to ask for your Social Security number, bank account, or credit card number.\n",
            "Charities Fraud: Scammers see our desire to help one another during a crisis as an opportunity. Before making any donation, please check the facts and make sure you are getting accurate information from a reputable source. See guidance from the Office of the Attorney General here. Check to make sure any organization you are supporting is officially registered, by going to verified sources like the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection, Better Business Bureau, Guidestar, or other sites listed in our guidance. Do not fall prey to high pressure tactics. If you receive a call or solicitation seeking a donation, take your time to get the facts. There is no need to commit to support on the spot.\n",
            "Price Gouging: The Office of the Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney’s Office are following up on hundreds of complaints regarding price gouging, including various types of health and medical resources necessary to respond to the spread of COVID-19. During civil preparedness and public health emergencies, price gouging is against Connecticut and federal law. Price gouging or profiteering means increasing the price of an item for sale by more than could be justified in the ordinary course of business market fluctuations – particularly in light of prior margins or profit per item. Price gouging may result in federal criminal prosecution or Connecticut enforcement action.  For more information on Connecticut’s price gouging statutes, click here.\n",
            "Hoarding and PPE Procurement Scams: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a Notice pursuant to President Trump’s Executive Order 13910 and the Defense Production Act, which designated health and medical resources necessary to respond to the spread of COVID-19 that are scarce or the supply of which would be threatened by excessive accumulation. These designated materials are subject to the hoarding prevention measures authorized under the Executive Order and the Act.  Individuals or businesses that violate the Act will be subject to prosecution.\n",
            "Phishing, Spoofing and Cyber Fraud: The Task Force warned Connecticut residents of widespread COVID-19 related cyber fraud. The Office of the Attorney General is aware of numerous reports of phishing attempts via email and text message regarding COVID-19 assistance and related aid. Do not click on links in unsolicited emails. Be wary of electronic communications purporting to be from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the World Health Organization. Be on alert for messages that request your personal information in exchange for benefits or relief. Make sure you are visiting legitimate, official websites for up-to-date information about COVID-19.\n",
            "Healthcare and Government Program Fraud:  Connecticut healthcare providers have been given additional regulatory flexibility to enhance their ability to treat patients impacted by the COVID-19 public health crisis.  Included among these recent changes are greater access for telemedicine, audio-only telephonic medicine and modifications to allow certain providers to practice prior to licensure.   The Attorney General’s Antitrust and Government Program Fraud Department is taking affirmative steps to ensure that the Connecticut Medicaid program is protected from fraudsters and scammers who may try and take advantage of the newly implemented policies and orders by submitting false claims for these services.  To that end, the Department’s investigators are actively reviewing Medicaid paid claims data to identify any aberrant providers and/or target suspicious claim activity.\n",
            "Small Business Loan Fraud Schemes:  Small business owners working hard to stay afloat should be wary of scammers charging up-front or excessive fees to secure U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans or offering high-interest bridge loans.  Scammers sometimes target businesses through email phishing schemes using SBA or bank logos. \n",
            "Mortgage and Student Loan Relief Scams:  Scammers often prey upon those facing financial hardship.  Borrowers having difficulty making their monthly mortgage or student loan payments should be wary of scams promising bogus relief.  Often requiring illegal up-front and reoccurring fees, scammers make deceptive claims regarding their ability to secure loan forgiveness.  To avoid becoming a victim of such scams, those with mortgage or student loans should instead contact their loan servicers (the entity to whom they make their payments) to seek relief. \n",
            "Connecticut residents may report COVID-19 related fraud to the Task Force by contacting the Office of the Attorney General via email at attorney.general@ct.gov or by calling 860-808-5318.  The Attorney General’s Office is coordinating closely with prosecutors and investigators at the U.S. Attorney’s Office and Chief State’s Attorney’s Office on criminal and civil fraud cases arising during this pandemic.\n",
            "Individuals also may report COVID-19 related fraud to the Department of Justice’s National Center for Disaster Fraud Hotline at 866-720-5721 or by visiting www.justice.gov/disastercomplaintform.  More information on the Justice Department’s coronavirus response effort is available here.\n",

Bonavolonta of the FBI’s Boston Field Office. “Thankfully we were able to stop them before taxpayers were defrauded, but today’s arrests should serve as a warning to others that the FBI and our law enforcement partners will aggressively go after bad actors like them who are utilizing the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to commit fraud.”\n",
            "“The alleged actions of defendants Staveley and Butziger are criminally reprehensible,” said Special Agent in Charge Kristina O’Connell of the IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI). “Defrauding a government program designed to provide financial assistance to small business owners during the Coronavirus pandemic is tantamount to taking money directly out of the pockets of those who need it most.  Today’s arrests exemplify the hard work, dedication and efficiency of IRS-CI and the entire investigative team.”\n",
            "“This is a critical time for our nation’s small businesses.  It is well known that fraudsters prey upon those in vulnerable positions,” said SBA Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware.  “As this result shows, SBA-OIG and its law enforcement partners are actively working together to root out fraud in SBA’s programs and bring those responsible to justice.  I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their leadership and dedication throughout this investigation.”\n",
            "According to court documents unsealed today in U.S. District Court in Providence, Rhode Island, the fraudulent loan requests were to pay employees of businesses that were not operating prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and had no salaried employees, or, as in one instance, to pay employees at a business the loan applicant did not own.\n",
            "Allegedly, Staveley and Butziger discussed via email the creation of fraudulent loan applications and supporting documentations to seek loans guaranteed by the SBA for COVID-19 relief through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). It is alleged that Staveley posed as his brother in real estate transactions.\n",
            "It is alleged that Staveley claimed in loan applications requesting more than $438,500 that he had dozens of employees at three restaurants he owned, two in Warwick, Rhode Island, and one in Berlin, Massachusetts. An investigation determined that one of the Rhode Island restaurants, the former Remington House, and the Massachusetts restaurant, On The Trax, were not open for business prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, at the time the loan applications were submitted, or at any time thereafter. Moreover, Staveley did not own or have any role in the second Rhode Island restaurant, Top of the Bay, for which he was seeking financial relief.\n",
            "According to court documents, Staveley’s Massachusetts restaurant was closed by March 10, 2020, when the town of Berlin revoked the business’ liquor license for numerous reasons, including that “Sanborn” allegedly misrepresented that his brother owned the restaurant. Investigators obtained information that Staveley/Sanborn allegedly used his brother’s personal identifying information in other real estate transactions as well.\n",
            "According to court documents, it is alleged that on April 6, 2020, Butziger filed an application seeking a $105,381 SBA loan under the PPP as owner of an unincorporated entity named Dock Wireless.  Butziger claimed in documentation filed with the bank and in a telephone call with an FBI undercover agent posing as a bank compliance officer that he had seven full-time employees on Dock Wireless’ payroll, including himself. Butziger falsely represented to the agent that he brought the employees on full-time on Jan. 1, 2020, and laid them off at the end of March. Butziger claimed the employees continued to work without being paid through April 2020, and that he would use SBA PPP funds to pay them.\n",
            "The Rhode Island State Department of Revenue provided information to the IRS of having no records of employee wages having been paid in 2020 by Butziger or Dock Wireless. Agents interviewed several of the supposed Dock Wireless employees who reported that they never worked for Butziger or Dock Wireless. \n",
            "The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.\n",
            "The PPP allows qualifying small-businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within eight weeks of receipt and use at least 75 percent of the forgiven amount for payroll. \n",
            "Staveley and Butziger are the first individuals in the nation charged with allegedly defrauding the CARES Act SBA Paycheck Protection Program.\n",
            "A federal criminal complaint is merely an accusation. A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n",
            "Assistant Chief Lawrence Atkinson of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee H. Vilker for the District of Rhode Island are prosecuting the case.\n",

            "GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN — United States Attorney Andrew Birge offered tips to help parents and guardians keep their children safe from on-line predators, commenting that: \"With schools and entertainment facilities closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, kids are using the Internet more and more. Unfortunately, that means online child sexual predators have increased access to them.\"\n",
            "1. Discuss Internet safety with children of all ages that are online. Many children do not realize that people may not be who they claim to be online. Similarly, many do not understand that someone who seems like a friend online could have a deviant motive.\n",
            "2. Set limits around who your children are allowed to communicate with. You may consider limiting young children to communicating only with people you have personally met. For older children, you may consider limiting them to communicating only with people they have met in person.\n",
            "3. Set limits around the kinds of devices and applications your children use. Online child sexual predators often use new technologies to avoid detection by law enforcement. If your child is using an application you have not heard of before, consider researching the application online or testing it out using your child’s account.\n",
            "4. Use technology to protect them. Many devices and programs allow parents to set parameters around which applications children may use and for how long. Similarly, many of these programs allow parents to see what their children are doing while using those applications.\n",
            "5. Pay attention to warning signs. Children who are sexually exploited are often embarrassed and hesitate to tell parents or other authority figures about their experiences. Pay attention if your child is withdrawing or changing their mood while their Internet activity increases.\n",
            "6. Report suspected abuse. Reporting can help minimize or stop further victimization. If you believe your child has been sexually exploited online, contact the United States Attorney’s Office, your local F.B.I. office, or report online at www.cybertipline.org.\n",

Oregonians should have confidence that our offices are doing everything in our power to prevent them from becoming the victim of COVID-19 fraud and abuse.”\n",

            "As this country adopts drastic measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, many Americans have lost their jobs and many more have seen their wages reduced. These losses have forced many to seek delays or suspensions of their rent, with reports that nearly one-third of Americans were unable to pay their April rent at the beginning of the month.\n",
            "The majority of landlords have responded to these circumstances with understanding and care, trying to work with their tenants to survive the current crisis. However, there have been reports of other landlords who have responded to requests to defer rent payments with demands for sexual favors and other acts of unwelcome sexual conduct. Such behavior is reprehensible. Unfortunately, many victims who experience this type of abuse never report it.  They fear retaliation will endanger their ability to provide shelter for themselves and their families. \n",

            "Link: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-files-statement-interest-support-church-ministers-underserved-communities\n",
            "Press Release:\n",
            "The Department of Justice today filed a Statement of Interest in a Virginia federal court concerning the First Amendment’s freedom of religion in support of Lighthouse Fellowship Church (Lighthouse), a congregation in Chincoteague Island, Virginia, that serves, among others, recovering drug addicts and former prostitutes.\n",
            "The Statement of Interest is part of Attorney General William P. Barr's April 27, 2020 Initiative directing Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Eric Dreiband, and the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, Matthew Schneider, to review state and local policies to ensure that civil liberties are protected during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n",
            "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Virginia’s governor issued executive orders that ban in-person religious services of more than 10 people while permitting such gatherings of workers in any non-retail business and an array of retail businesses, including liquor stores, dry cleaners and department stores. Violations of the orders allow for criminal charges and carry penalties of up to a year in a jail and a $2,500 fine.\n",
            "As alleged by Lighthouse, on April 5, 2020, the church held a sixteen-person worship service in its 225-seat sanctuary while maintaining rigorous social-distancing and personal-hygiene protocols. At the end of the service, the Chincoteague police department issued Lighthouse’s pastor a criminal citation and summons, based on the governor’s executive orders. Lighthouse filed suit and on Friday, the district court denied the church’s request for preliminary relief, stating in part that “[a]lthough [professional-services] businesses may not be essential, the exception crafted on their behalf is essential to prevent joblessness.”\n",
            "“For many people of faith, exercising religion is essential, especially during a crisis,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division. “The Commonwealth of Virginia has offered no good reason for refusing to trust congregants who promise to use care in worship in the same way it trusts accountants, lawyers, and other workers to do the same. The U.S. Department of Justice will continue to monitor any infringement of the Constitution and other civil liberties, and we will take additional appropriate action if and when necessary.”\n",
            "“As important as it is that we stay safe during these challenging times, it is also important for states to remember that we do not abandon all of our freedoms in times of emergency,” said Matthew Schneider, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, who, with Assistant Attorney General Dreiband, is overseeing the Justice Department’s effort to monitor state and local polices relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Unlawful discrimination against people who exercise their right to religion violates the First Amendment, whether we are in a pandemic or not.” \n",
            " “The Commonwealth cannot treat religious gatherings less favorably than other similar, secular gatherings,” said G. Zachary Terwilliger, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. “As we stated in our filing, we do not take a position in this Statement on the advisability of in-person gatherings. Indeed, the proper response to the COVID-19 pandemic will vary over time, and will depend on facts on the ground.”\n",
            "In its Statement of Interest, the United States explains that governments may take necessary and temporary measures to meet genuine emergencies, and that states and localities should be afforded substantial deference in their response to emergency situations such as the current pandemic. “But,” the Statement explains, “there is no pandemic exception to the Constitution and its Bill of Rights.” Because the executive orders prohibit Lighthouse’s sixteen-person, socially distanced gathering in a 225-seat church but allow similar secular conduct, such as a gathering of 16 lawyers in a large law firm conference room, the governor’s executive orders may constitute a violation of the church’s constitutional rights to the free exercise of religion.\n",

            "Press Release:\n",
            "SHREVEPORT/LAFAYETTE/ALEXANDRIA/LAKE CHARLES/MONROE, La. – United States Attorney David C. Joseph, Western District of Louisiana, United States Attorney Brandon J. Fremin, Middle District of Louisiana, and United States Attorney Peter G. Strasser, Eastern District of Louisiana, jointly announced today that the State of Louisiana received $9,688,333 in a Department of Justice grant to respond to the public safety challenges posed by the outbreak of COVID-19.\n",
            "The grant to Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement is available under the Coronavirus Emergency Supplemental Funding program, authorized by the recent stimulus legislation signed by President Trump. In addition to the state award, $5,039,791 has been allocated to local agencies throughout Louisiana, with $2,282,168 being set aside for 22 jurisdictions in the Western District, $1,946,546 for 12 jurisdictions in the Eastern District of Louisiana, and $811,077 for five jurisdictions in the Middle District of Louisiana. Those jurisdictions can find out if they are eligible and apply immediately by visiting this website. The Justice Department is moving quickly, awarding grants on a rolling basis and aiming to have funds available for drawdown as soon as possible after receiving applications.\n",
            "“Our law enforcement officers and first responders are facing new challenges posed by COVID-19 and need our support,” said U.S. Attorney Joseph. “This grant will help provide our officers with the tools they need to maintain public health and safety as we battle the coronavirus pandemic. I thank our law enforcement partners for their service to the citizens of the Western District of Louisiana and encourage them to take advantage of this funding opportunity.”\n",
            "U.S. Attorney Fremin stated, “This funding is a tremendous boost allowing law enforcement and first responder agencies to enhance their efforts in combatting COVID-related personnel and community issues specific to their jurisdictions. This grant serves as another demonstration of the Department’s commitment to support law enforcement’s front line efforts in not only protecting themselves in the line of duty, but also the citizens and communities they serve.”\n",
            "“The citizens of Southeast Louisiana have been severely affected by the onslaught of COVID-19 throughout their communities. Without the unwavering dedication and selflessness of first responders and public safety professionals, who are on the frontlines of this battle, our community would be adrift. The allocation of these funds provides the opportunity to support those who support us,” said U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana, Peter G. Strasser.\n",
            "“The outbreak of COVID-19 and the public health emergency it created are sobering reminders that even the most routine duties performed by our nation’s public safety officials carry potentially grave risks,” said Katharine T. Sullivan, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs. “These funds will provide hard-hit communities with critical resources to help mitigate the impact of this crisis and give added protection to the brave professionals charged with keeping citizens safe.”\n",
            "The law gives jurisdictions considerable latitude in the use of these funds for dealing with COVID-19. Potential uses include hiring personnel, paying overtime, purchasing protective equipment, and distributing resources to hard-hit areas. Funds may also be used to help correctional facilities cover costs related to COVID-19, including, but not limited to, sanitation, contagion prevention and measures designed to address the related medical needs of inmates, detainees, and correctional personnel.\n",
            "Agencies that were eligible for the fiscal year 2019 State and Local Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program are candidates for the emergency funding. Local units of government and tribes will receive direct awards separately according to their jurisdictions’ allocations. For a list of all awards thus far, visit the Coronavirus Emergency Supplemental Funding program webpage.\n",
            "The Office of Justice Programs, directed by Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Katharine T. Sullivan, provides federal leadership, grants, training, technical assistance and other resources to improve the nation’s capacity to prevent and reduce crime, assist victims and enhance the rule of law by strengthening the criminal and juvenile justice systems.

            "KANSAS CITY, KAN. - U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister is asking anyone who has witnessed or experienced sexual harassment by a landlord, property manager, maintenance worker or anyone with control over housing to report that conduct to the Department of Justice.\n",
            "“COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted the ability of many people to pay rent on time and has increased housing insecurity,” McAllister said. “Nationally, there have been reports of housing providers trying to exploit the crisis to sexually harass tenants. Sexual harassment in housing is illegal, and we stand ready to investigate such allegations and pursue enforcement actions where appropriate.”\n",
            "McAllister said his office will work closely with state and local partners to identify incidents of sexual harassment in housing.\n",
            "The Justice Department’s Sexual Harassment in Housing Initiative is an effort to combat sexual harassment in housing led by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, in coordination with U.S. Attorney’s offices across the country. The goal of the initiative is to address sexual harassment by landlords, property managers, maintenance workers, loan officers or other people who have control over housing.\n",
            "Launched in 2017, the initiative has filed lawsuits across the county alleging a pattern or practice of sexual harassment in housing and recovered millions of dollars in damages for harassment victims. The Justice Department’s investigations frequently uncover sexual harassment that has been ongoing for years. Many individuals do not know that being sexually harassed by a housing provider can violate federal law or that the Department of Justice may be able to help.\n",
            "The Department of Justice, through the Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney’s offices, enforces the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, and disability. Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Act.\n",
            "The Department encourages anyone who has experienced sexual harassment in housing, or knows someone who has, to contact the Civil Rights Division by calling (844) 380-6178 or emailing fairhousing@usdoj.gov.\n",
            "McAllister said complaint forms also are available on his office’s web site at /media/981871/dl?inline. Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrea Taylor is the Civil Rights Coordinator for McAllister’s office (913-551-6730).\n",
            " More information about civil rights enforcement in Kansas is available at https://www.justice.gov/usao-ks/civil-rights\n",
            "Individuals may also file a complaint alleging harassment or discrimination in housing with the Department of Housing and Urban Development through HUD’s website or by calling (800) 669-9777.\n",

            "“Those who prey on others look for opportunities like the various loans provided to small businesses.  United States Attorneys and our respective law enforcement partners, like the FBI, are on the lookout for those predators.  We strongly encourage those who become aware of such scams to report it to the authorities so we can take action” said U.S. Attorney Bill Powell, Northern District of West Virginia.\n",
            "“West Virginia businesses are struggling to survive a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. The last thing we need are criminals scamming the essential aid meant to help businesses survive,” said U.S. Attorney Mike Stuart, Southern District of West Virginia. “Fraudsters and scammers never miss an opportunity to fraud and scam even in desperate times. Small businesses are the backbone of our state’s economy. We have their back.  We will do all we can to protect them.”\n",
            "\"Fraudsters will take advantage of any opportunity to steal money,\" said FBI Pittsburgh Acting Special Agent in Charge Eugene Kowel. \"We recognize that criminals could try to prey on small businesses during this time of fear and anxiety.

            "When the CARES Act was signed into law, the doors were opened for small businesses to access $349 billion in federal aid at a most crucial time for entrepreneurs that are balancing the health and safety of their families and themselves while operating their small business.  And while small businesses take note of the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) and the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), so do those with bad intentions.\n",
            "“Unfortunately, small businesses are being targeted at a time they are most vulnerable,” noted SBA West Virginia District Director Karen Friel. “Look out for phishing attacks and scams utilizing the SBA logo.  These may be attempts to obtain your personally identifiable information (PII), to acquire personal banking access, or to install ransomware or malware on your computer.”\n",
            "Entrepreneurs should remember that if anyone asks you for money, they are not legitimate, nor are emails that end in anything but “.gov”. \n",
            "The SBA does not reach out to initiate a loan, nor does the SBA ask for information previously provided in the application process.\n",
            "If you have any doubt, reach out to your nearest SBA office to ask. As you are working harder than ever to preserve your business and its employees amid the Coronavirus pandemic, do not allow bad actors to hinder your efforts. \n",

Anderson announced that the Department of Justice has devoted law enforcement resources to address housing-related sexual harassment resulting from the current COVID-19 crisis. The Department of Justice remains vigilant in investigating and prosecuting wrongdoing related to the pandemic, including sexual harassment by landlords, property managers, maintenance workers, loan officers or other people who have control over housing.\n",
            "U.S. Attorney Anderson made the announcement to remind the public that sexual harassment in housing will not be tolerated and that the Department of Justice is focused on addressing this problem.\n",
            "“Sexual misconduct in housing and rental situations can be just as pernicious as harassment in the workplace,” U.S. Attorney Anderson said. “Landlords and superintendents who try to capitalize on the current crisis by sexually harassing people in need of housing should know that reports of misconduct will be investigated and pursued.”\n",
            "As the country adopts drastic measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, many Americans have lost their jobs and many more have seen their wages curtailed. These losses have forced many to seek abatements or suspensions of their rent. Many landlords have responded to these circumstances with understanding and care, trying to work with their tenants to weather the current crisis. There have been reports, however, of other landlords who have responded to requests to defer rent payments with demands for sexual favors and other acts of unwelcome sexual conduct. Such behavior is illegal.\n",
            "The Department of Justice remains remaining vigilant in investigating and prosecuting wrongdoing related to the pandemic. To address predatory practices by unscrupulous landlords, Attorney General Barr directed Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Eric Dreiband, and Christina Nolan, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Vermont to oversee and coordinate U.S. Attorneys’ Offices efforts to devote all necessary resources to investigate reports of housing-related sexual harassment resulting from the current crisis.\n",

            "Press Release:\n",
            "Tacoma - A former Port Angeles, Washington, naturopathic physician was charged today with a federal felony related to his attempts to promote a misbranded drug as a prevention for COVID-19, announced U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran.  RICHARD MARSCHALL, 67, is scheduled to make his initial appearance via teleconference in U.S. District Court in Tacoma on May 12, 2020, on a charge of Introduction of Misbranded Drugs into Interstate Commerce.  \n",
            "“At a time when scientists are scrambling to identify COVID-19 treatments and vaccines, it is unconscionable and cruel to take people’s money for false hope and promises of a cure,” said U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran.  “This defendant knew better than to be peddling misbranded drugs.  Fortunately, the community quickly notified law enforcement when they saw he had launched this scheme with a COVID-19 twist.”\n",
            "According to the criminal complaint, on March 26, 2020, Food and Drug Administration criminal investigators began reviewing complaints from the public regarding postings on Facebook and a website linked to MARSCHALL that claimed the “Dynamic Duo” of substances could kill viruses, including the coronavirus.  MARSCHALL billed himself as a “Health Coach” and retired naturopath.  Various posts promote two substances that can “stop” coronavirus.\n",
            "On March 30, 2020, an FDA investigator spoke to MARSCHALL on the telephone in an undercover capacity.  MARSCHALL represented to the investigator that one of the substances “doesn’t boost the immune system, it just kills the virus.”  MARSCHALL represented that the second substance would boost the production of white blood cells that attack infections.  The undercover agent ultimately ordered the “Dynamic Duo” for $140 plus shipping. \n",
            "The substances were received by FDA investigators in early April, along with documents.  A review showed they were manufactured in facilities in Illinois and Texas.  The original labeling for the substances does not claim to kill viruses, but still MARSCHALL included documents that stated the substances can “crush …. viral infections including those in the Corona family, like in China Corona-19.”\n",
            "“Making claims that unproven drugs can prevent or treat COVID-19 causes more harm than good. Fraudulent products making false claims can be dangerous,” said Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “We will investigate and bring to justice those who try to profit from the pandemic by offering unproven and illegally marketed coronavirus drugs.”\n",
            "The charges contained in the complaint are only allegations.  A person is presumed innocent unless and until he or she is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n",
            "In 2011 and again in 2017, MARSCHALL was convicted and sentenced in federal court for distributing misbranded drugs.  Due to these prior convictions, MARSCHALL faces increased penalties for introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce -- up to three years in prison and a $10,000 fine.  In 2018, the Washington State Department of Health permanently revoked his credential to practice as a naturopath. \n",
            "The case is being investigated by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigation (FDA-OCI).  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Brian Werner who serves as the COVID-19 Fraud Coordinator for the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n",

            "Indianapolis – United States Attorney Josh J. Minkler announced today, April E. Hayworth, 31, Indianapolis, and Christina A. Smith, 37, Indianapolis, were charged today on federal drug, conspiracy, and burglary charges.   \n",
            "“During this COVID19 pandemic, it is vitally important to protect our medical system and the supplies that are needed to treat patients and protect our medical workers.” said Minkler. “These individuals were trying to make some quick money at the cost of endangering innocent lives. This conduct will not be tolerated during a pandemic or ever.”\n",
            "On April 14, 2020, two females broke into a restricted medication storage area at the Central Indiana Cancer Center and stole thirty carpujets of morphine, a schedule II controlled substance. With a covering over their heads, each individual opened multiple cabinets, removing the missing controlled substances. Agents also discovered that Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”) and other medical supplies had been stolen from the hospital, including 7 boxes of Isolation masks; 50 tubs of Sani-wipes; 10 containers of soap; 20 bottles of hand sanitizer; 8 bottles of air deodorizer; and 6 tubs of bleach wipes.\n",
            "During the investigation, one of the females was identified as April Hayworth, a member of the cleaning crew at the hospital. Further investigation identified the other female as Christina Smith. Investigators discovered that Smith planned on selling the morphine.\n",
            "Investigators later observed Smith entering a vehicle with an associate. Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Officers initiated a traffic stop. Ms. Smith was identified and arrested on an outstanding arrest warrant. During the arrest, officers discovered twenty-nine carpujets of morphine in the vehicle.\n",
            "This case was the result of an investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department.\n",
            "“It is absolutely shameful with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, that Ms. Hayworth and Ms. Smith would burglarize the Central Indiana Cancer Centers, and steal a significant amount of morphine and personal protective equipment.” said DEA Assistant Special Agent in Charge, Michael Gannon. “The DEA Tactical Diversion Squad, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, United States Attorney’s Office, Indiana University Health Care, and the cleaning company are to be commended for their assistance in holding Ms. Hayworth and Ms. Smith accountable for their misconduct.”\n",
            "“As our community faces the challenges that result from COVID-19, it is our collective responsibility to support the healthcare workers serving on the frontlines of this pandemic - and that means ensuring they have all of the tools, and especially the Personal Protective Equipment, they need to serve residents,” said IMPD Chief Randal Taylor. “We are in this together.

            "Burlington - United States Attorney General William Barr has directed Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Eric Dreiband and Christina Nolan, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Vermont, to oversee and coordinate the Department of Justice’s efforts to address this issue during the current pandemic.\n",
            "As the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the ability of many people to timely pay rent and increased housing insecurity, the Department of Justice has heard reports of housing providers trying to exploit the crisis to sexually harass tenants. Sexual harassment in housing is illegal, and the Department of Justice stands ready to investigate such allegations vigorously and pursue enforcement actions where appropriate.\n",
            "“It is always despicable to exploit vulnerabilities by sexually harassing those in need of housing,” said U.S. Attorney Christina Nolan. “Doing so during a global pandemic, when so many are struggling just to make ends meet, is particularly abhorrent.  We thank those in our communities, including landlords and property owners, who are coming together to support those who are hardest hit financially.  Sadly, there are some who do the opposite, by sexually exploiting those afraid of losing their homes.  This conduct will not be tolerated, and they will be held accountable.” The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Vermont will work closely with state and local partners to identify any incidents of sexual harassment in housing and will use all available enforcement tools against perpetrators.\n",
            "“The Fair Housing Act authorizes the U.S. Department of Justice take swift action against anyone who sexually harasses tenants,” said Eric Dreiband, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.  “Landlords, property owners, and others who prey on vulnerable tenants during the COVID-19 pandemic should be on notice. We will bring the full resources of the United States Department of Justice to the fight against sexual harassment in housing. We will defend the right of tenants and their families to live peacefully and securely in their homes without the added stress, pain, fear, and turmoil of dealing with sexual predators.”\n",
            "The Justice Department’s Sexual Harassment in Housing Initiative is an effort to combat sexual harassment in housing led by the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, in coordination with U.S. Attorney’s Offices across the country. The goal of the Initiative is to address sexual harassment by landlords, property managers, maintenance workers, loan officers or other people who have control over housing.\n",
            "Launched in 2017, the Initiative has filed 14 lawsuits alleging a pattern or practice of sexual harassment in housing and recovered millions of dollars in damages for harassment victims. The Justice Department’s investigations frequently uncover sexual harassment that has been ongoing for years or decades.  Some victims do not know that being sexually harassed by a person in control of their housing can violate federal law.\n",
            " \n",
            "The Department of Justice, through the U.S. Attorney’s Offices and the Civil Rights Division, enforces the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, and disability. Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Act.\n",
            "The Department encourages anyone who has experienced sexual harassment in housing, or knows someone who has, to contact the Civil Rights Division by calling (844) 380-6178 or emailing fairhousing@usdoj.gov.\n",
            "Individuals who believe they may have been victims of discrimination may also file a complaint with the U.S. Attorney’s Office by filling out the Complaint Form, which can be found at https://www.justice.gov/usao-vt.\n",

            "“Due to COVID-19, children are online more than ever increasing their susceptibility to dangerous predators lurking online,” Town said.  “Parents are, and remain, the best first line of defense to the practice of digital and cyber hygiene and making certain that online predators cannot access our children.  Stay safe at home.  Stay safe online.”\n",
            "“The internet, for all its benefits, also gives criminals and predators an easy way to reach young people,” Sharp said.  “I want to encourage parents to have open and ongoing conversations about safe and appropriate online behavior and immediately report any inappropriate contact between an adult and your child to law enforcement.”\n",

            "In response to a civil complaint and accompanying court papers filed on April 27, 2020, in Salt Lake City, the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah issued a temporary restraining order against defendants Gordon Pedersen of Cedar Hills, Utah, and his companies, My Doctor Suggests LLC and GP Silver LLC.  The civil complaint alleges that the defendants are fraudulently promoting and selling various silver products for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.  The court’s order temporarily enjoins the defendants from continuing to sell or distribute their silver products for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease, including COVID-19. \n",

            "The complaint alleges that, beginning in early 2020, the defendants conducted a scheme to defraud consumers throughout the United States, promoting and selling silver products based on fraudulent claims of protection against, and treatment for, COVID-19.  According to the complaint, the defendants have made a wide variety of false and misleading claims touting silver products as a preventative for COVID-19, including that having silver in the bloodstream will “usher” any coronavirus out of the body and that “it has been proven that Alkaline Structured Silver will destroy all forms of viruses, it will protect people from the Coronavirus.” \n",

            "\"The pandemic is dangerous enough without wrongdoers seeking to profit from public panic and this sort of conduct cannot be tolerated.\" said Attorney General Barr.  To address predatory practices by unscrupulous landlords, Attorney General Barr directed the Department’s Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney’s to coordinate efforts to devote all necessary resources to investigate reports of housing-related sexual harassment resulting from the current crisis.\n",
            "As the country adopted drastic measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, Americans have lost jobs with many more having their wages curtailed.  These losses have forced many to seek abatements or suspensions of their rent.  Many landlords responded to these circumstances with understanding by working with tenants during the crisis.  Other landlords, however, have demanded sexual favors and other acts of unwelcomed sexual conduct in exchange for deferral of rent payments.

            "Our country now faces a challenge the likes of which none of us have ever experienced.  The coronavirus has upended every American’s daily life.  It threatens the health of every man, woman, and child.  It has disrupted business, our basic social interactions, and how government goes about doing the work of the people. \n",
            "I know that the impacts of this pandemic are  particularly felt by all of law enforcement.  And perhaps by local law enforcement most of all.  Americans look to you to keep their communities safe, and even before this health crisis came across the Pacific and hit our shores, your jobs required you to confront dangers on a daily basis and to make great sacrifices.  But now, your operating environment has never been more challenging.  At the Justice Department, we know that because we are seeing and experiencing it too.  And we also know the consequences for doing our jobs well are also high, and how important it is to continue our tasks and protect the public in these challenging times. \n",
            "Today, we have assembled a panel of representatives from across the Department of Justice to share with you the trends we have been seeing, what trends we expect to emerge, and what we are doing to address it.  We think that coordinating closely with you to address these challenges is very important.  After all, as I said when I spoke to you last year, everyone in law enforcement are all members of the same team.\n",
            "We have had a great partnership for over 75 years.  And we should always look for ways to strengthen that partnership.  I anticipate that today’s discussion will only further demonstrate that we are committed to working shoulder-to-shoulder with you in service of the safety and security of the American people.\n",
            "So, again, thank you so much for your time and participation today.  We look forward to all the important things we can accomplish together in this battle against the coronavirus and the bad actors that want to take advantage of this pandemic.  Thanks for letting me start things off today, and thank you as well for everything you do on a daily basis to serve our nation and the American people.\n",

            "HONOLULU, Hawaii – U.S. Attorney Kenji M. Price is urging those who have experienced housing-related sexual harassment to report such conduct to the Department of Justice. While many landlords have accommodated their tenants in response to the economic hardships posed by the COVID-19 crisis, there have been reports of landlords responding to requests to defer rent payments with demands for sexual favors and other acts of unwelcome sexual conduct.\n",
            "“Sexual harassment in housing is an often underreported, but egregious violation of the right to fair housing,” U.S. Attorney Price said. “Landlords and property managers who use their power to exploit those desperately in need of housing during a crisis, and engage in other predatory practices, will face the long arm of the law. The Attorney General has asked my fellow U.S. Attorneys and I to investigate reports of housing-related sexual harassment resulting from the current crisis, and my office is committed to uncovering such violations where they exist and bringing justice to victims by vigorously enforcing the law.”\n",
            "The Department of Justice--through the U.S. Attorney’s Offices and the Civil Rights Division, enforces the federal Fair Housing Act--which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, and disability. Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Act. The Justice Department brings cases each year involving unlawful landlord conduct, including allegations of defendants exposing themselves sexually to current or prospective tenants, requesting sexual favors in exchange for reduced rents or making necessary repairs, making unrelenting and unwanted sexual advances to tenants, and evicting tenants who resisted their sexual overtures. More information about the Department of Justice’s Sexual Harassment in Housing Initiative is available on its webpage at https://www.justice.gov/crt/sexual-harassment-housing-initiative.\n",
            "Anyone who has experienced sexual harassment in housing, or knows someone who has, is encouraged to contact the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division by calling 1.844.380.6178 or emailing fairhousing@usdoj.gov.

            "          GRAND RAPIDS - The United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California unsealed charges today in a criminal complaint charging Rodney L. Stevenson II with wire fraud for his operation of an e-commerce site that allegedly scammed several customers into paying for N95 masks that they never received. The announcement was made by U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California David L. Anderson, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Michigan Andrew B. Birge, U.S. Postal Inspection Service San Francisco Division Postal Inspector in Charge Rafael E. Nuñez, U.S. Postal Inspection Service Detroit Division Acting Inspector in Charge Felicia George, FBI Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett, and FBI Special Agent in Charge Detroit Field Division Steve D’Antuono.\n",
            "          \"Hospitals, healthcare providers and everyday people are understandably anxious to obtain N95 masks, N99 filters and other PPE,\" said U.S. Attorney Anderson. \"The criminal element is always ready to prey on fear and uncertainty, and it is all too easy to lie over the internet. While sheltering in place, Americans are shopping on the internet like never before. The complaint alleges a consumer’s nightmare of fake webpages and false promises.\"\n",
            "         \"The reach of federal law enforcement is long. If someone uses the internet to commit alleged fraud, their victims can be from anywhere and they could find themselves facing those victims and subject to serious federal charges far from home,\" said U.S. Attorney Birge. \"After some preliminary hearings here in West Michigan, all future proceedings related to these very serious allegations will be in Northern California.\"\n",
            "          \"One of the core tenets of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service’s mission is to support and protect customers of the U.S. Postal Service. Not only does that mean investigating and taking action against such exploitative behavior as alleged in this case, but also educating consumers how to be proactive in protecting themselves\", said AIC Felicia George. \"We urge citizens to do their due diligence when dealing with an unknown business or entity online, and if they believe they have been a victim of fraud, report it to us immediately at www.uspis.gov so that we can take the appropriate action.\"\n",
            "          \"The FBI across the country will continue to be vigilant in deterring, detecting, and investigating wrongdoing related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Stevenson’s alleged behavior was reprehensible. Under no circumstances is it permissible to over-inflate the prices of much-needed safety equipment and then either provide substandard product or fail to provide the product altogether,\" said SAC D'Antuono. \"The severe penalties for scams like the one alleged here should serve as a warning to others.\"\n",
            "          According to the complaint, Stevenson, 24, of Muskegon, Michigan, controlled EM General, a Michigan limited liability company created in September 2019. EM General operated a website that purported to sell an available inventory of \"Anti-Viral N95\" respirator masks. An N95 respirator mask is a particulate-filtering facepiece respirator that meets the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health N95 standard of air filtration. N95 masks, which cover the user’s nose and mouth, are required to filter at least 95% of airborne particles.\n",
            "          The complaint further alleges EM General, through its website, falsely claimed to have N95 respirator masks \"in stock\" and available for sale and shipment during the shortage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on these and other representations, customers bought masks from the website, sometimes paying EM General more than $40 or more per mask. Stevenson is alleged to have taken several steps to fraudulently make EM General appear to be a legitimate company. For example, Stevenson invented a fictional Chief Executive Officer, \"Mike Thomas,\" from whom fraudulent emails were sent, as well as several other fake officers or employees of the company. Stevenson also used stock photographs from the internet to create a page depicting this team of fake professional management staff. After customers made their first purchase, the defendant offered additional masks to those customers at discounted prices.\n",
            "          The complaint describes how four victims paid for, but did not receive, N95-compliant masks. Three of the four victims reside in the San Francisco Bay Area, including one hospital employee. Also described in the complaint are follow-up emails from EM General to customers in which false excuses about supply and shipping issues were made. Three of the four customers in the complaint never received the promised products at all despite multiple representations that the masks had been shipped. The fourth customer paid over $400 on March 2, 2020, for N95 masks represented to be \"in stock,\" and, after raising several complaints, on March 27, 2020, received cheaply made fabric masks. The masks, delivered in a white envelope with no return address, did not comply with the N95 standard that EM General purportedly sold.\n",
            "          Stevenson is charged with wire fraud. If convicted, he faces up to 30 years in prison, followed by five years of court supervision, and a fine of up to $1,000,000.\n",
            "          Stevenson was arrested at his home in Muskegon, Michigan, and made his initial appearance before the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan in Grand Rapids. Dates for further proceedings remain to be determined.\n",
            "          The case is being prosecuted by the Special Prosecutions Section of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California. This case is being investigated jointly by the San Francisco and Detroit Divisions of the United States Postal Inspection Service and the San Francisco and Detroit field offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n",
            "          A complaint merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and any defendant so charged is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n",

Moore for the Southern District of Alabama today announced that the State of Alabama received $9,645,679 in Department of Justice grants to respond to the challenges posed by the outbreak of COVID-19.\n",
            "The grant is available under the Coronavirus Emergency Supplemental Funding program, authorized by the recent stimulus legislation signed by President Trump. In addition, to the state award, over $4.8 million has been allocated to local agencies throughout Alabama, with $2,954,663 being set aside for twenty-five jurisdictions in the Northern District. Those jurisdictions can find out if they are eligible and apply immediately by visiting this website. The Justice Department is moving quickly, awarding grants on a rolling basis and aiming to have funds available for drawdown as soon as possible after receiving applications.  Jurisdictions not listed for individual allocations may be eligible to apply for part of the state funding through the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs.\n",
            "“The COVID- 19 pandemic has created many challenges for law enforcement and our first responders to safely perform important duties,” Town said.  “These funds from DOJ will be used to ensure that our brave men and women of the badge can continue the mission of safeguarding the citizens of our great state.”\n",
            "“As the coronavirus crisis continues, every day law enforcement officers and first responders knowingly put themselves at risk of exposure as they do their jobs serving and protecting the community,” stated U.S. Attorney Louis V. Franklin, Sr. “This funding will help the State of Alabama and numerous local agencies that are struggling with limited resources to address many critical needs. I encourage all agencies eligible to apply for funding to do so.”\n",
            "“The outbreak of COVID-19 and the public health emergency it created are sobering reminders that even the most routine duties performed by our nation’s public safety officials carry potentially grave risks,” said Katharine T. Sullivan, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs. “These funds will provide hard-hit communities with critical resources to help mitigate the impact of this crisis and give added protection to the brave professionals charged with keeping citizens safe.”\n",
            "The law gives jurisdictions considerable latitude in the use of these funds for dealing with COVID-19. Potential uses include hiring personnel, paying overtime, purchasing protective equipment and distributing resources to hard-hit areas. Funds may also be used to help correctional facilities cover costs related to COVID-19, including, but not limited to, sanitation, contagion prevention and measures designed to address the related medical needs of inmates, detainees and correctional personnel.\n",
            "Agencies that were eligible for the fiscal year 2019 State and Local Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program are candidates for the emergency funding. Local units of government and tribes will receive direct awards separately according to their jurisdictions’ allocations.

            "The complaint alleges Dr. Mok submitted false and fraudulent claims to Medicare for treatment of varicose veins by submitting claims for injections of Varithena in veins which had previously been ablated.  The complaint alleges that once an ablation is done on a patient, there is no need for additional treatments including a Varithena injection.  The complaint also alleges that some of the procedures were also medically unnecessary as numerous patients received up to 19 Varithena injections per leg and/or up to 12 ablations per leg, well beyond what is medically necessary to treat their conditions.\n",
            "The complaint further alleges that Dr. Mok submitted false and fraudulent claims to Medicare for high-dose intravenous vitamin C infusions to patients at risk of contracting COVID-19, especially those working on the frontlines, and to those who tested positive for COVID-19. The infusions were primarily performed at Allure’s Shelby Township location. While the office had standard protocols to isolate patients who were positive for COVID-19, the complaint alleges that those protocols were not strictly followed, and on numerous occasions, COVID-19 positive patients were comingled with healthy patients, including those scheduled for non-essential elective procedures, in Allure’s one waiting room.\n",
            "In multiple launch videos, Dr. Mok claimed that Allure offered the infusions because vitamin C reduces the severity of symptoms, duration of illness, and therefore the contagiousness of COVID-19 and significantly increases the immunity system of those who have a high risk for contracting the virus. There are currently no known U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vaccines or drugs to treat COVID-19.\n",
            "If any patients or staff have any concerns about their health or exposure to Covid-19, we urge them to consult with a trusted medical professional.\n",
            "A complaint is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt.  Trial cannot be held on felony charges in a complaint.  When the investigation is completed a determination will be made whether to seek a felony indictment.\n",
            "The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Regina McCullough, Wayne Pratt and John Neal. The investigation is being conducted jointly by the FBI and HHS-OIG.\n",

            "CHARLOTTE, N.C. – A New York man appeared in federal court today, on charges of traveling from Brooklyn to Charlotte for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor, announced Andrew Murray, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina.  Manuel Oppenheimer, 26, had his initial appearance this morning before U.S. Magistrate Judge David S. Cayer.\n",
            "John A. Strong, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in North Carolina; Sheriff Eddie Cathey of the Union County Sheriff’s Office; and Chief Kerr Putney of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department join U.S. Attorney Murray in making today’s announcement.\n",
            "“The internet has been an essential tool during the COVID-19 outbreak, helping children continue their studies through remote learning and stay connected with teachers, classmates, friends and family through social media and other apps,” said U.S. Attorney Murray. “However, more unmonitored screen time can lead to an increased risk of exposure to all the dangers that lurk on the internet, including child predators who leverage social media to target and exploit innocent children. I urge parents to take proper precautions and be extra-vigilant in monitoring their children’s online activity, so kids can continue to take advantage of all the positive things the digital world has to offer and safely use their electronic devices to enrich their lives, while staying safe from predators and other online threats.”\n",
            "According to allegations contained in the federal charging document, on April 16, 2020, the Union County Sheriff’s office received information regarding a missing 14-year-old female, who was possibly located in Charlotte with an adult male, later identified as Oppenheimer. CMPD officers were able to locate the minor at a residence in Charlotte, and the minor was returned to Union County.  Law enforcement subsequently arrested Oppenheimer.\n",
            "According to allegations in the criminal complaint, law enforcement determined that Oppenheimer met the minor on “Omegle,” a free online chat website, and later began talking to the minor on “Snapchat,” a mobile app that allows users to share messages, photos, and videos.  The federal criminal complaint alleges that Oppenheimer wanted to meet the minor in April due to the COVID-19 outbreak, otherwise it was possible their meeting would need to be postponed up to a year, until the outbreak was over.   The criminal complaint further alleges that the defendant was aware that the victim was a minor, and that he traveled from New York to Charlotte to meet with the minor for the purpose of engaging in sexual contact.\n",
            "Oppenheimer is charged with one count of traveling across state lines for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity with a minor. He is currently in federal custody.\n",
            "The charges contained in the criminal complaint are allegations.  The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n",

            "SACRAMENTO, Calif. — U.S. Attorney McGregor W. Scott and Rod Ammari, Special Agent in Charge of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), Office of Investigations, Western Field Division, today warned the public to be aware of scammers attempting to intercept Economic Impact Payments being delivered by the Internal Revenue Service.\n",
            "U.S. Attorney Scott and SAC Ammari announced an effort to provide taxpayers with the necessary information to avoid falling victim to criminals using this pandemic as an opportunity to commit fraud. TIGTA has established a website for citizens to report IRS-related Coronavirus scams at tips.TIGTA.gov. You may also contact TIGTA’s investigative offices in Fresno at 559-458-7377 or in Sacramento at 916-974-5774.\n",
            "Most eligible taxpayers will receive their payment through direct deposit into their bank account. Taxpayers that traditionally receive tax refunds via paper check, including many elderly citizens and those who do not use banking services, will receive their payments via U.S. Treasury check delivered by mail by the U.S. Postal Service.\n",
            "“During this national emergency, all Californians must remain vigilant against those who are plotting ways to scam them out of their COVID-19 economic impact payments,” said U.S. Attorney Scott. “It is critical that suspicious calls and efforts are immediately reported to law enforcement.”\n",
            "“TIGTA is the agency responsible for protecting the integrity of Federal tax administration, including attempts to impersonate the IRS to defraud taxpayers,” said Special Agent in Charge Ammari. “We are committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate and bring to justice any individual or organization that engages in criminal activity and exploits this national crisis as a means to commit fraud.”\n",
            "U.S. Attorney Scott and SAC Ammari offered the following tips on how to identify and report attempted scams involving the Economic Impact Payments:\n",
            "\n",
            "The IRS will not call you, text you, or email you to prompt you for more information as a prerequisite to getting an Economic Impact Payment.\n",
            "To check on the status of your Economic Impact Payment, please visit www.IRS.gov and click on “Get My Payment.” Only use the website www.IRS.gov. Do not use any other websites or services that claim to be able to process your Economic Impact Payment or act as an intermediary between you and the IRS. Similarly, do not click on any links in e-mails that purport to take you to the IRS website. The best practice is to manually type “www.IRS.gov” into your web browser.\n",
            "Anyone who calls you claiming to be from the IRS and offering to process your Economic Impact Payment is impersonating the IRS. Do not share any personal or financial information with these scammers.\n",
            "Do not share your personal information with anyone, whether claiming to be from the IRS or some other business or government agency, offering to assist you with your Economic Impact Payment. Payments will be delivered by the IRS through direct deposit or via U.S. Treasury check delivered by mail by the U.S. Postal Service.\n",
            "Do not share your online banking username or password with anyone. The IRS does not need your online banking username and password in order to send your Economic Impact Payment.\n",
            "\n",
            "After your Economic Impact Payment has been sent, the IRS will send you a letter confirming your payment. If you receive this letter, but you have not received your Economic Impact Payment, please report the missing payment to TIGTA through our website at tips.TIGTA.gov. You will also need to report the missing payment separately to the IRS.\n",

            "WASHINGTON –The United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia obtained a warrant today authorizing seizure of coronaprevention.org.  The enforcement action against the owner of a fraudulent website follows Attorney General William Barr’s recent direction for the Department to prioritize the detection, investigation, and prosecution of illegal conduct related to the pandemic.\n",
            "            The seizure warrant alleges that the owner of the domain name, coronaprevention.org, posted it for sale on a hackers forum. The post appeared the day after the President declared a national emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The seller stated on the forum that this domain would be an effective way to sell “high markup in demand products.”  The seller exponentially marked up the price of the domain. The seller asked for the payment to be made via bitcoin. \n",
            "            The warrant further alleges that the seller engaged in conversations with an undercover agent from Homeland Security Investigations about the sale of the domain.  The seller stated that it was “genius” to sell “fake testing kits” using this domain.  The seller further stated that the seller “wanted to do that but I couldn’t get enough cash to bulk buy them from Alibaba [a Chinese e-commerce site].”  The seller directed the undercover agent on how to set up a new website on the domain using a foreign-based service, so as to prevent U.S. authorities from being able to shut it down in the future.\n",
            "            “We will not tolerate exploitation of this national emergency for personal gain,” said U.S. Attorney Timothy J. Shea.  “This Office will not allow fraudsters to use anonymous online spaces and cryptocurrency to hide their harmful activities and prey on victims.”\n",
            "            “Sadly, criminals are using the current pandemic as an opportunity to generate proceeds while so many Americans are suffering,” said William S.

            "Press Release:\n",
            "SAN FRANCISCO – The United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California unsealed charges today in a criminal complaint charging Carmelita Barela and Rosetta Shabazz with committing robbery affecting interstate commerce in connection with a scheme to steal merchandise from a Walgreens while claiming to have COVID-19, announced United States Attorney David L. Anderson and Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett. \n",
            "“It is an unfortunate reality that there will be those in our community who try to take advantage of the current pandemic to prey on people’s fear of contracting COVID-19,” said U.S. Attorney Anderson.  “While many in our community can remain safe by sheltering in place, store managers and clerks are putting themselves out into the world for our benefit.  They don’t deserve to be threatened and robbed.  Everyone suffers from a crime like this.”\n",
            "“In a time when our communities have come together to be responsible and stay safe, the FBI will simply not tolerate the criminal actions of the few individuals who use fear and intimidation to endanger others,” said Special Agent in Charge Bennett.  “We must protect the front-line service workers who are providing the public with the critical supplies we all need.”\n",
            "According to the complaint, on April 6, 2020, Barela, 36, and Shabazz, 32, both of San Francisco, entered a Walgreens near San Francisco’s Civic Center with empty bags and without wearing masks.  After the store manager offered assistance, Shabazz allegedly began to cough without covering her mouth.  The store manager asked Shabazz to leave the store if she was sick.  Instead, Shabazz walked over to Barela and both defendants began to cough audibly while taking merchandise off the shelves and placing it into their bags.  The manager told the defendants to leave the store, to which they responded by saying, “We have COVID.”  The defendants continued to cough audibly and eventually left the store without paying for the merchandise they placed into their bags.\n",
            "The defendants are charged with robbery affecting interstate commerce (Hobbs Act Robbery), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951. A complaint merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  If convicted, the defendants each face a maximum sentence of 20 years of prison and a $250,000 fine.  In addition, the court may order restitution and an additional term of supervised release.  However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3553. \n",
            "Barela and Shabazz were arrested on April 23, 2020. Shabazz made her initial appearance this morning before Magistrate Judge Kandis Westmore and was released to home confinement.  Her next appearance is scheduled for April 28, 2020,  before Judge Westmore, for a bond hearing.  Barela’s next appearance is scheduled for April 27, 2020, before Magistrate Judge Thomas Hixson for an initial appearance.\n",

            "Check online reviews of any company offering COVID-19 products or supplies.  Avoid companies whose customers have complained about not receiving items.\n",
            "Research any charities or crowdfunding sites soliciting donations in connection with COVID-19 before giving any donation.  Remember, an organization may not be legitimate even if it uses words like “CDC” or “government” in its name or has reputable looking seals or logos on its materials.  For online resources on donating wisely, visit the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) website.\n",

            "Stephen McAllister, U.S. Attorney for the District of Kansas, and Karl A. Stiften, Special Agent in Charge, Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), St. Louis Field Office, made the announcement today in an effort to prevent taxpayers from falling victim to criminals using the recently approved economic impact payments as an opportunity to commit a crime.\n",
            "Automatic COVID-19 economic impact payments started being deposited into taxpayers’ accounts on April 11. For most Americans, this will be a direct deposit into your bank account. For the unbanked, retirees or other groups who have traditionally received tax refunds via paper check, they will receive their economic impact payment in this manner as well. Scammers may try to get you to sign over your check to them or use this as an opportunity to get you to “verify” your filing information in order to receive your money, and then use your personal information at a later date to file false tax returns in an identity theft scheme. Because of this, everyone receiving a COVID-19 related economic impact payment from the government is at risk.\n",
            "Karl A. Stiften, Special Agent in Charge of the IRS-CI St. Louis Field Office warned “The existence of a deadly national pandemic will not stop criminals seeking to capitalize on the fears and difficulties faced by the public as they try to line their own pockets by stealing your money or your personal information.”\n",
            "“Our office is on alert for Covid-19 crimes in Kansas,” U.S. Attorney McAllister said. “You can make a report by emailing us directly at USAKS.Covid.Fraud@usdoj.gov or by calling the National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) hotline (1-866-720-5721).”\n",

            "• The IRS will deposit your check into the direct deposit account you previously provided on your tax return (or, in the alternative, send you a paper check).\n",
            "• The IRS will not call and ask you to verify your payment details. Do not give out your bank account or any other account information - even if someone claims it's necessary to get your check. It's a scam.\n",
            "• If you receive a call, don't engage with scammers or thieves, even if you want to tell them that you know it's a scam, or you think that you can beat them. Just hang up.\n",
            "• If you receive texts or emails claiming that you can get your money faster by sending personal information or clicking on links, delete them. Don't click on any links in those emails or texts.\n",
            "• Reports are also swirling about bogus checks. If you receive a check that requires that you verify the check online or by calling a number, it’s a fraud.\n",
            "\"IRS Criminal Investigation alongside the U.S. Department of Justice are prioritizing these types of investigations to help protect taxpayers and the tax system, especially those looking to prey on vulnerable taxpayers,” said Special Agent in Charge Stiften. “Remember, go directly and solely to IRS.gov for official information.” \n",

            "KANSAS CITY, KAN. – U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister and FBI Special Agent in Charge Timothy Langan are urging educators and parents in Kansas to be alert as students who are out of school spend more time on the internet.\n",
            "“Our young people today face more online threats than ever, and that was true before the Kansas schools closed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,” McAllister said. “Now, children are likely spending even more time online each day, which gives predators more opportunities to exploit them. In this new environment, we want to remind parents, educators, caregivers, and children about the dangers of online sexual exploitation, urge the adults to watch for the signs of such exploitation and abuse, and to report to and engage federal and state law enforcement authorities when exploitation and abuse are suspected or discovered.”\n",
            "McAllister said children sometimes can be too trusting online and befriend people they may not know. Predators take advantage of this and target children, often between the ages of 10 and 17, typically through social media. Children across all demographics and genders can be targeted and exploited. Sexual exploitation, even when there is never any physical contact, causes very real harm and has a lasting impact. Images and videos do not disappear from the Internet, and the long term effects can be devastating.\n",
            "Online sexual exploitation can come in many forms. Sextortion occurs when a predator entices a victim into providing sexually explicit images or videos—usually by falsely pretending to be a teen, someone much younger and different than their real identity—and then threatens to share the images publicly if the victim fails to comply with the predator’s demands for increasingly explicit and degrading images and videos.\n",
            "“In order for such victimization to stop, children typically need adult intervention and assistance,” McAllister said. “They have to come forward to someone they trust—a parent, teacher, friend, or caregiver—who can then cut off the communications and report the situation to us, which will permit law enforcement to go after the predator.”\n",
            "McAllister and Langan urge parents to review the resources regarding child exploitation and other crimes related to COVID-19 at https://www.fbi.gov/coronavirus. If you suspect or become aware of possible sexual exploitation of a child, please contact the FBI, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, or your local law enforcement agency and report it. Such exploitation is a serious federal crime carrying severe federal penalties.\n",
            "“Federal law enforcement has taken an aggressive approach toward the investigation and prosecution of COVID-19 related crimes such as fraud, price-gouging and hoarding of essential medical supplies,” McAllister said. “But we stand ready to act just as aggressively against those who might seek to take advantage of this situation to exploit our children.”\n",

Jackson of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), Washington Field Office are again warning taxpayers to be alert to phishing scams relating to COVID-19 economic impact payments that are already being seen.  The community must remain on guard against scammers who are striving to steal personal information and money. \n",
            "“It is reprehensible that fraudsters try to take advantage of this global pandemic to line their pockets at the expense of the most vulnerable,” said U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur.  “The U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to bringing these criminals to justice.  I urge citizens to remain vigilant.  Don’t provide personal information or click on websites or links contained in unsolicited e-mails.  Don’t become a victim.”\n",
            "“The community is experiencing enough hardship right now without needing to worry about scammers trying to steal the money that they desperately need,” said Special Agent in Charge Kelly R. Jackson.  “IRS-CI, along with our law enforcement counterparts are working hard to protect the public from these thieves.  These types of investigations are being prioritized to help protect taxpayers and the tax system” \n",
            "According to federal law enforcement, many of the scams operated from websites that advertised fake vaccines and cures, operated fraudulent charity drives, delivered malware, or hosted various other types of scams.  To attract traffic, these websites often utilized domain names that contained words such as “covid19” or “coronavirus.”  In some cases, the fraudulent sites purported to be run by, or affiliated with, public health organizations or agencies.                  \n",
            "Neither the IRS nor any other federal agency will call you, text you, e-mail you, or contact you on social media asking for personal or bank account information—even related to the economic impact payments.  Recently, there has been an increase in phishing schemes utilizing e-mails, letters, texts and links. These contacts will often come in the form of unsolicited e-mail and/or websites that pose as legitimate sites in an effort to lure unsuspecting victims to provide personal and financial information.  Scammers will often use website names similar to valid ones—for example IRSGOV, IRS GOV, or using extra letters and/or spaces in lieu of IRS.GOV.  For example, one fraud involves phishing e-mails coming from “customer_service@FreeFillableForms.com” which directs you to a link that contains “economic impact payment” and uses a company name similar to the Free File Alliance partner you are transferred to while using the IRS tool for Non-Filers.  DO NOT click on the link—this is a scam.  Other phishing schemes are using keywords such as “Corona Virus,” “COVID-19,” and “Stimulus” in varying ways.\n",
            "When visiting a website or when you receive an e-mail containing a link, pay special attention to any web address you are directed to in order ensure it is from a legitimate source.  Watch out for e-mails with attachments or links claiming to have special information about economic impact payments or refunds. \n",
            "Federal law enforcement is united in its efforts to fight against COVID-19 fraud.  If you think you are a victim of a fraud or attempted fraud involving COVID-19, call the National Center for Disaster Fraud Hotline at 1-866-720-5721 or e-mail at disaster@leo.gov.  If it is a cyber scam, you may submit your complaint through the FBI’s website, https://www.ic3.gov.  Or you can report suspicious e-mails to the IRS at phishing@irs.gov.\n",

            "The Department of Justice announced today that it will not challenge collaborative efforts of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (AmerisourceBergen) to identify global supply opportunities, ensure product quality, and facilitate product distribution of medications and other healthcare supplies to treat COVID-19 patients.\n",
            "AmerisourceBergen’s collaborative efforts form yet another part of the emergency response developed and led by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to address urgent supply needs across the nation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            "“We commend AmerisourceBergen’s efforts to assist the United States in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic through improved supply of medicines to those most in need,” stated Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the department’s Antitrust Division.  “We also appreciate AmerisourceBergen’s intention to comply with the antitrust laws, regardless of circumstances.  Division staff worked expeditiously to resolve its request for a Business Review Letter within our ambitious seven-day target.” \n",
            "AmerisourceBergen is working on a number of initiatives under the direction of the government to help resolve supply challenges presented by the pandemic. These initiatives are focused on facilitating the government’s efforts to guide medications and other healthcare supplies to the places where they are needed most.  This includes the distribution of hydroxychloroquine from the government’s Strategic National Stockpile to health care providers in areas of greatest need.  AmerisourceBergen is instructed on volumes and ship-to destinations, and then leverages its distribution network.  AmerisourceBergen’s conduct falls within the same emergency response efforts that dictated the Medical Supplies Distributors’ conduct evaluated in a previous Business Review Letter.  The response, therefore, leverages the same analytical framework.\n",

Stephen Muldrow y el Elder Justice Task Force (EJTF, por sus siglas en inglés) anunciaron hoy el lanzamiento de una iniciativa de toma de pruebas COVID-19 a todos los residentes y empleados en los hogares y centros de cuido prolongado para adultos mayores de Puerto Rico. Esta iniciativa multi-agencial y multisectorial cubrirá más de 1,000 instalaciones, 28,000 residentes y 9,000 empleados y cuidadores durante las próximas tres semanas. Este esfuerzo ha sido posible con el apoyo del Departamento de Salud de P.R., el Task Force Médico de la Gobernadora de P.R., el Departamento de la Familia de P.R., la Unidad de Control de Fraudes contra Medicaid del Departamento de Justicia de P.R., la Guardia Nacional de P.R., la Oficina del Procurador de Personas de Edad Avanzada, así como los Centros de Salud Federalmente Calificados (Centros 330) participantes, con subvenciones de Direct Relief, una organización humanitaria cuya misión es mejorar la salud y la vida de las personas afectadas por pobreza o emergencias.\n",
            "Durante las últimas semanas, los miembros del EJTF desarrollaron protocolos y guías para prevenir y contener la propagación de la COVID-19 en los hogares de cuido prolongado de Puerto Rico. Cuando Puerto Rico comenzó con el cierre y la cancelación de visitas en éstas instituciones a mediados de marzo, quedó claro que debía establecerse un protocolo para manejar casos sospechosos de la COVID-19 en los centros de cuido de adultos de edad avanzada.  El EJTF, con ayuda de especialistas, desarrolló un algoritmo para manejar casos sospechosos de la COVID-19 en estas instalaciones.\n",
            "La semana pasada, el Departamento de Salud de P.R. proporcionó 50,000 kits de pruebas rápidas para la iniciativa, que serán respaldados por pruebas moleculares (PCR, por sus siglas en inglés), de conformidad con los protocolos acordados. Hoy lanzamos esta iniciativa en tres hogares de ancianos, y también nos embarcamos en una iniciativa proactiva más amplia con la cooperación de la Guardia Nacional de P.R. Con la asistencia de la Guardia Nacional, esperamos evaluar a todos los residentes y empleados en los hogares de cuido prolongado de Puerto Rico en las próximas tres semanas.\n",
            "Una vez que la iniciativa se implemente completamente, hasta 100 equipos estarán en el campo diariamente realizando pruebas de la COVID-19. Como parte de la estrategia se ha incorporado una plataforma en línea creada por el Departamento de la Familia de P.R. para ingresar los datos y generar informes con los resultados de las pruebas, al terminar las misiones diarias. La Oficina de Epidemiología del Departamento de Salud de P.R. también ha expresado su compromiso con este esfuerzo, y llevará a cabo el seguimiento de contactos, asesorará a los centros y ayudará con la colocación de los residentes, de ser necesario.\n",

This multi-agency, multi-sectoral initiative will cover over 1,000 facilities, 28,000 residents, and 9,000 employees and caregivers during the next three weeks. This effort has been possible with the support of the P.R. Department of Health, the P.R. Governor’s Medical Task Force, the P.R. Family Affairs Department, the P.R. Department of Justice’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, the P.R. National Guard, the P.R. Office of the Ombudsman for the Elderly, as well as the participating Federally Qualified Health Centers (330 Centers), with grants from Direct Relief, a humanitarian organization whose mission is to improve the health and lives of those affected by poverty or emergencies.\n",
            "The members of the EJTF have spent the past weeks developing protocols and guidelines to prevent and contain the spread of COVID-19 in Puerto Rico’s long-term care facilities. As Puerto Rico entered lock-down and cancellation of visits in nursing homes in mid-March, it became clear that a protocol had to be set in place to handle suspected cases of COVID-19 in nursing homes. The EJTF, with the help of specialists, developed an algorithm to handle suspected cases of COVID-19 in these facilities.\n",
            "Last week, the P.R. Department of Health provided 50,000 rapid test kits for the initiative, which will be backed up by molecular (PCR) testing, pursuant to the agreed upon protocols. Today we launch this initiative in three long-term care facilities, and we also embark on a larger proactive initiative with the assistance of the P.R. National Guard. With the help of the P.R. National Guard, we expect to test all seniors and employees in Puerto Rico’s nursing homes within the next three weeks.\n",
            "Once the initiative is fully implemented, up to 100 teams per day will be in the field conducting COVID-19 testing. The strategy has incorporated an online platform created by the P.R. Family Affairs Department to input data and generate reports with testing results, at the end of each day’s missions. The P.R. Department of Health’s Epidemiology Office has also pledged its support for this effort, and will conduct contact tracing as well as provide counseling to nursing facilities and assist with placement of residents, if needed.\n",

            "Press Release:\n",
            "The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas has obtained a temporary restraining order preventing a DFW chiropractor from touting sham treatments for COVID-19, announced U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox.\n",
            "According to a civil complaint filed Thursday, Dr. Ray L. Nannis, the 48-year-old proprietor of Richardson-based Optimum Wellness Solutions, advertised his homeopathic sublinguals as both a “C-19 vaccine” and a “treatment, reducing severity and duration of symptoms, should you test positive.”\n",
            "(As government officials have widely publicized, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration has not identified any immunizations, treatments, or cures for the novel coronavirus to date.)\n",
            "The Court order, handed down Friday by U.S. District Judge Jane J. Boyle, prevents Dr. Nannis from promoting worthless and potentially dangerous treatments and requires him to immediately take down all misleading internet posts.\n",
            "In videos posted to Optimum’s Facebook account, Dr. Nannis promoted and offered to sell homeopathy that supposedly provided “up to 90 percent protection” from COVID-19, according to court documents.\n",
            "“It will help us avoid being sick or if you do get sick, it’s going to make it very, very, very minimal,” the chiropractor declared in a video posted on April 1.\n",
            "In a call with a government agent, Dr. Nannis insisted that his homeopathy could provide protection from the novel coronavirus —“more so than any other vaccine out there right now” — and claimed the so-called treatments would also minimize symptoms associated with contracting COVID-19. Although he cautioned that he could not “technically” describe the homeopathy as a “cure” for coronavirus due to FDA restrictions, he nevertheless stated that it “basically” was “for all intents and purposes.”\n",
            "Dr. Nannis, who is a licensed chiropractor but lacks a medical degree or medical license, offered to sell the homeopathy sublinguals to the government agent for $95 per dose.\n",
            "Alleging Dr. Nannis was facilitating a “predatory” ongoing wire fraud scheme to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic, the government sought injunctive relief under the Anti-Fraud Injunction statute.\n",
            "The enforcement action follows Attorney General William Barr’s recent memo to U.S. Attorneys nationwide to prioritize the detection, investigation, and prosecution of unlawful conduct related to the pandemic.\n",
            "“As a community, we cannot and will not allow individuals to peddle false hope during this pandemic in order to line their own pockets,” said U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox. “By promoting these unsubstantiated ‘treatments’ for COVID-19, this defendant substituted profits for the safety of the public.  We are gratified the Court acted quickly to put a stop to this egregious conduct.”\n",
            "“The subject in this case abused his position of trust for his own personal benefit by preying on customers’ basic human condition, fear, by selling a fictitious COVID-19 remedy.  This case should serve as a strong deterrent for those considering taking part in similar fraud schemes,” said William Smarr, Special Agent in Charge of the United States Secret Service’s Dallas Field Office.  “The Secret Service, along with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas, and in partnership with our federal, state and local counterparts will continue to combat COVID-19 related fraud. As this pandemic evolves and federal funds are distributed to those suffering from economic losses, the Secret Service will continue to detect, investigate and arrest criminals who attempt to prey on vulnerable citizens and businesses.”\n",
            "The U.S. Secret Service conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrew Robbins and Kenneth Coffin are handling the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Fabio Leonardi is the Coronavirus Fraud Coordinator for the Northern District of Texas.\n",
            "Under the leadership of Attorney General Barr, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas remains vigilant in detecting wrongdoing related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and is committed to investigating and prosecuting scammers who attempt to prey upon the public’s fear.

            "“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service will be extra vigilant as Economic Impact Payments are mailed to approximately 80 million Americans across the country,” said Peter R. Rendina, Inspector in Charge of the Washington Division of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. “We are prepared to protect our employees, our customers, and the U.S. Mail from criminals who are looking to take advantage of our nation during the Coronavirus pandemic. We will continue to work in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our partners in the COVID-19 Task Force to investigate anyone who seeks to take advantage of consumers during these unprecedented times, and bring them to justice.”\n",
            "In response to the significant economic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States Government passed a $2 trillion stimulus package which includes providing Economic Impact Payments (EIPs) to millions of Americans. These EIPs will be distributed in two ways: direct deposit into recipient’s bank accounts and Treasury checks or debit cards mailed by the U.S. Treasury. The distribution of electronic direct deposits has already started. The mailings through the U.S. Postal Service of Treasury checks are expected to begin April 20.\n",
            "“Fraudsters frequently prey upon vulnerable individuals during difficult times,” said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. “We are working closely with our law enforcement partners like the U.S. Postal Inspection Service to guard against fraudulent pandemic profiteers, as well as to ensure the rule of law and public safety is not eroded during this critical time.

            "The U.S. Postal Inspection Service will have a critical security and investigative role to ensure these checks make it to intended recipients. U.S. Postal Inspectors are preparing to protect against and prevent criminal activities that may arise relating to the distribution of these benefits. There will also likely be a variety of related fraud schemes to investigate as criminals attempt to exploit these EIP mailings for their own greed.\n",

            "Link: https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/united-states-attorney-mcswain-fbi-warn-potential-videoconferencing-hacking-during\n",
            "Press Release:\n",
            "PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney William M. McSwain warned the community today about the potential for hackers to invade and disrupt videoconference meetings that are taking place as Americans use video-teleconferencing (VTC) platforms to conduct online meetings during the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
            "“In the weeks following the coronavirus outbreak, videoconferencing platforms have become a part of daily living, used in a variety of ways – from conducting online classes, to hosting extended family gatherings, to holding large corporate meetings,” said U.S. Attorney McSwain. “Unfortunately, we have also seen an uptick in video hacking, where cyber actors hijack VTC meetings and cause a variety of harms, from showing inappropriate images to making death threats. Hackers beware: this behavior is not funny in any way and will not be tolerated.”\n",
            "As individuals continue to engage in online learning and social and business meetings during the pandemic, law enforcement recommends exercising due diligence and caution and encourages users to take the following steps to mitigate videoconferencing threats:\n",
            "\n",
            "Do not make the meetings or classrooms public. Videoconferencing platforms have options under “settings” to make meetings private by requiring participants to enter a meeting password, follow a link to a meeting, or wait in a virtual “waiting room.”  These are all features that allow the host to limit public access and control admission of guests.\n",
            "\t \n",
            "Do not share a meeting link publicly. Do not use publicly accessible social media platforms to share your meeting link with participants. Provide the link directly to specific people.\n",
            "\t \n",
            "Manage screen-sharing options. Most VTC platforms have screen-sharing capability so that participants can see a host’s presentations, a feature often used in online classroom settings. Change the screen-sharing setting to “Host-Only” so that participants cannot share their screens.\n",
            " \n",
            "Download updates. Ensure that users are using the updated version of remote access/meeting applications, as many VTC platforms have built in additional security measures in their latest updates.\n",
            "\t \n",
            "Familiarize yourself with the VTC platform’s capability to remove intruders and lock meetings. Most VTC platforms have ways for hosts to remove participants and prevent them from re-joining and to lock meetings once all participants have joined. Consult with your employer’s IT professionals for more information about these features.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you are a victim of a video-teleconference hijacking or any cybercrime, you can report it to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center at www.ic3.gov. If you receive a specific threat of harm during a videoconference, please report it at tips.fbi.gov, 1-800-CALL-FBI, or by calling FBI Philadelphia at 215-418-4000.\n",

Coleman, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky, along with Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron on Friday jointly released a public service announcement (PSA) regarding fraudulent COVID-19 testing sites.\n",
            "The 60-second PSA alerts Kentuckians to the dangers of fraudulent COVID-19 testing sites and urges them to work with a licensed healthcare provider if they experience COVID-19 symptoms.  The Commonwealth’s COVID-19 website, kycovid19.ky.gov, contains guidance on when to seek care for COVID-19 symptoms. \n",
            "Scammers may use fraudulent testing sites to obtain personal information and payment from patients, often without fully processing the tests or providing patients with the results.\n",
            "“We want Kentuckians who need COVID-19 testing to get it, but we are encouraging Kentuckians to follow the direction of state and local officials and health departments, including about where to seek legitimate testing,” said U.S. Attorney Duncan. “Kentuckians should be aware that fraudulent COVID-19 testing sites are appearing across the Commonwealth, but they should rest assured that law enforcement is aware of this risk, proactively monitoring the situation, and pursuing criminals who are trying to take advantage of this extraordinary situation.”\n",
            "“Thieves using the cover of this health threat to prey on Kentuckians would be well-advised to avoid the Commonwealth as arrest and prosecution await you here,” said U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman. “Please assist law enforcement by reviewing these indicators of fraud, use good common sense, and report any concerns as quickly as possible.”\n",
            "“Information regarding the availability of COVID-19 testing is rapidly changing to keep pace with demand, and we want to arm Kentuckians with tips and information on how to avoid fraudulent COVID-19 testing sites,” said Attorney General Cameron. “Just a few weeks ago, our office opened an investigation into pop-up COVID-19 testing sites in Louisville after learning they were engaging in questionable practices, and we’re prepared to go after any testing site that seeks to take advantage of Kentuckians during the pandemic.”\n",
            "The following tips should be used to avoid fraudulent COVID-19 testing sites:\n",
            "\n",
            "Contact a trusted, licensed healthcare provider if you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and believe you need to be tested.\n",
            "Avoid any testing site that requires up-front payments or payments in cash only.\n",
            "Contact your local health department to confirm the validity of a testing site. You can access the contact information for local health departments here. \n",
            "\n",
            "U.S. Attorney Duncan, U.S. Attorney Coleman, and Attorney General Cameron, recently partnered with the FBI to launch the Kentucky Coronavirus Fraud Task Force. The mission of the task force is to identify, investigate, and prosecute fraud related to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic impacting Kentuckians.\n",

Gurganus, the indictment alleges that from in or about April 2020 to in or about October 2020, Abdullah filed Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) claims for herself and other ineligible recipients, to include inmates. The alleged scheme included making false representations in connection with these claims including, being unemployed as a result of Covid-19, providing false employment or wage history, falsely stating the applicant was willing, and able to work each day, and was seeking full-time employment. It is also alleged that Abdullah received kickbacks when she filed fraudulent claims for PUA with another’s information.The PUA program was created by the March 2020 CARES Act, as part of the United States government’s efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the public’s health and economic well-being. The PUA program was designed to provide unemployment benefits to individuals not eligible for regular unemployment compensation or extended unemployment benefits.The case was investigated by the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of the Inspector General.\\xa0 Assistant United States Attorney Alisan V. Martin is prosecuting the case.A sentence following a finding of guilt is imposed by the Judge after consideration of the applicable federal sentencing statutes and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The maximum penalty under federal law for wire fraud is 20 years’ imprisonment. Each charge may also carry a fine and a term of supervised release following imprisonment.Indictments are only allegations. All persons charged are presumed to be innocent unless and until found guilty in court.On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

From February 2016 through September 2019, Harvell and others recruited individuals to obtain lines of credit at various businesses using the SSNs. After fraudulently obtaining the lines of credit, they obtained jewelry and other merchandise. Harvell resold some of the merchandise and lines of credit on social media platforms.In April 2021, Harvell submitted a PPP loan application to a lender authorized by the Small Business Administration (SBA) to lend funds for approved PPP loan applications. The PPP loan application falsely claimed that Harvell operated her own business. Throughout the loan application Harvell made multiple false statements regarding her purported gross income and expenses associated with operating her business. In support of her PPP loan application, she submitted a false IRS Form 1040 - Profit or Loss From Business. It contained false statements about operating expenses, gross income, and wage expenditures for her purported business. Harvell’s business did not exist. In reliance on the false statements made in her loan application, Harvell’s application was approved, and she received a PPP loan totaling $20,415.After receiving the PPP loan proceeds in her bank account, Harvell began making withdrawals and spending the funds on personal expenses. In October 2021, Harvell submitted a PPP loan forgiveness application to the SBA that included multiple false representations. In the application, she falsely claimed that she spent more than $18,000 on payroll costs and that the PPP loan proceeds were only used for eligible purposes.

Kirkpatrick.According to court documents, from April 2020 through January 2022, Abdinasir Mahamed Abshir, 33, claimed to be operating a child nutrition site in Mankato, Minnesota, a mid-sized city in Southwestern Minnesota. \\xa0Abshir ran his food site, Stigma-Free Mankato, under the sponsorship of Feeding our Future. \\xa0Shortly after creating the Stigma-Free Mankato site, the defendant falsely claimed to be serving meals to 3,000 children a day, seven days a week, from J’s Sambusa, a small restaurant in North Mankato. \\xa0Abshir also created a shell company called Horseed Management, and claimed it was a meal vendor for the Stigma-Free Mankato food site. Between November 2020 and November 2021, Abshir and his co-conspirators falsely claimed to have served approximately 1.6 million meals to children through Stigma-Free Mankato.To accomplish their scheme, Abshirand his co-conspirators prepared and submitted fake meal counts, invoices, and attendance rosters. Rather than use fraudulently obtained money to serve meals or feed children, Abshir and his co-conspirators fraudulently misappropriated much of it. \\xa0Abshir transferred millions of dollars from Horseed Management to himself and other co-conspirators, which included transferring fraud proceeds to a shell company the defendant created called Calikamin Enterprise. Abshir used fraudulent proceeds to purchase a 2021 Range Rover, which has been seized and will be forfeited to the United States.According to court documents, Abshir paid more than $100,000 in bribes and kickbacks from Horseed Management to Abdikerm Eidleh, a Feeding Our Future employee, in exchange for sponsoring and facilitating Stigma-Free Mankato’s fraudulent participation in the Federal Child Nutrition Program. In exchange, Feeding Our Future received nearly $420,000 in administrative fees for sponsoring the Stigma-Free Mankato site’s participation in the program. \\xa0In December 2021, Abshir paid $5,750 to a GoFundMe account for Feeding Our Future created by Aimee Bock.In total, Stigma-Free Mankato received over $5.4 million in payments from Feeding Our Future based on fraudulent claims.In addition, on February 18, 2025, Abshir attempted to obstruct or impede the administration of justice when he communicated with a cooperating witness in the trial of his co-defendants in United States v. Aimee Bock and Salim Said. \\xa0Specifically, in the hallway outside Courtroom 13W in the U.S. Federal Courthouse in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Abshir approached a witness who was about to testify in the trial. \\xa0After learning that the witness was about to testify that day, Abshir requested that the witness come with him to the bathroom to have a conversation. \\xa0Abshir pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court before Judge Nancy E. Brasel. In his plea, he acknowledges that an enhancement will apply to his Sentencing Guidelines because he obstructed justice when he attempted to tamper with a witness. \\xa0A sentencing hearing will be scheduled at a later date.The case is the result of an investigation by the FBI, IRS – Criminal Investigations, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Joseph H. Thompson, Matthew S. Ebert, Harry M. Jacobs, and Daniel W. Bobier are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Baune is handling the seizure and forfeiture of assets.'},\n",

Diane Theus and Erica Abson Robins each have been charged with two counts of bank fraud. Janet Theus, Diane Theus, Erica Abson Robins, and Ronald Lee Robins are charged with one count of unlawful use of unauthorized access devices.Janet Theus and Diane Theus surrendered to federal authorities today and are scheduled to be arraigned this afternoon in United States District Court in downtown Los Angeles.Erica Abson Robins and Ronald Lee Robins were arrested Wednesday. Spears surrendered to federal authorities on Wednesday. All three of these defendants were arraigned and pleaded not guilty to all charges. An April 29 trial date was scheduled. Erica Robins and Spears were ordered released on $10,000 bond. A detention hearing was scheduled for March 11 for Ronald Robins, who remains in federal custody.According to the indictment returned February 12 and unsealed today, the defendants from April 2020 to July 2022 executed a scheme to collect and share personal information, including names and Social Security numbers, from individuals to fraudulently receive COVID-19 unemployment cash benefits. After collecting this personal information, the defendants submitted fraudulent COVID-19 unemployment assistance applications, falsely claiming that the applicants had lost jobs because of the pandemic. Janet Theus, Diane Theus, and Erica Robins then withdrew cash at ATMs from the job-loss cash assistance accounts they conspired to create.The indictment further alleges that, in total, defendants caused at least approximately 293 applications for unemployment benefits to be filed, resulting in payouts of approximately $3.3 million. Approximately 169 of the benefits applications the defendants caused to be filed were for children under the age of 18, approximately 106 of which were for children under the age of 10. The defendants also caused to be submitted at least 17 COVID-19 job-loss claims for individuals who were in fact incarcerated prisoners.The indictment also alleges that Erica Robins used her position as a California Highway Patrol dispatcher to query a law enforcement database containing Social Security numbers and dates of birth regarding an inmate at the California Men’s Colony state prison in San Luis Obispo, which was then used to obtain COVID-19 job-loss cash benefits. At the time, Erica Robins’ husband, Ronald Robins, was an inmate at that same prison. While incarcerated, Robins collected Social Security numbers and dates of birth from other inmates, which Janet Theus and Diane Theus then used to withdraw COVID-19 job-loss cash benefits.An indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.If convicted of all charges, the defendants would face a statutory maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for each bank fraud-related count. Janet Theus, Diane Theus, Erica Robins, and Ronald Robins would face up to 10 years in federal prison for unlawful use of unauthorized access devices.On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud.

LOUIS – A couple who ran a local non-profit were arrested Tuesday after having been accused in an indictment of stealing more than $7 million that was supposed to feed low-income Missouri children.FBI special agents also seized a pickup truck, two vans and a minivan that were purchased with what the indictment calls fraudulently-obtained funds.Diarra Williams, 30, and Nicholas Warford, 31, both of Edwardsville, Illinois, were indicted on Feb. 26 with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, six counts of wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of obstruction of an official proceeding. They are scheduled to enter a not guilty plea Tuesday afternoon.The indictment says the couple defrauded Missouri’s At-Risk Afterschool Program and Summer Food Service Program, which are funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Meals are served by schools and non-profit organizations. Williams ran a non-profit called The Bailey Foundation, which fraudulently claimed it served more than 2.2 million meals, the indictment says. Williams and Warford then laundered the meal money through a company owned by Warford, Warford’s Classic Catering LLC, by creating fake invoices that showed meal purchases that were never made, the indictment says.The indictment says the scheme lasted from March 2020 through July 2022. An April 2021 invoice falsely claimed that 208,456 meals were served, each of which included an eight-ounce serving of milk, the indictment says. Warford’s company bought no milk and paid less than $5,000 for food, it says.The indictment says Williams and Warford used the money to buy a $1.4 million home in Edwardsville, a 2018 Lincoln Navigator, a 2019 Ram 1500 Rebel pickup, a 2011 Mercedes Benz Sprinter, a 2017 Chrysler Pacifica and two 2021 Ram Promaster vans. They also spent $140,000 on extravagant vacations, $100,000 on furniture, home electronics and landscaping for their new home, more than $50,000 in school tuition payments and $460,000 on Warford's mother, the indictment says.The couple falsely claimed in reports to the state that they’d spent the money on feeding children and told the IRS that their lavish spending represented legitimate business expenses of Warford’s company, the indictment says. They also tried to impede the investigation by producing phony invoices in response to a federal grand jury subpoena, the indictment says.The indictment seeks the forfeiture of vehicles and the couple’s home.Charges set forth in an indictment are merely accusations and do not constitute proof of guilt. \\xa0Every defendant is presumed to be innocent unless and until proven guilty.“The alleged fraud is beyond despicable,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Chris Crocker of the FBI St. Louis Division. “The defendants allegedly stole millions in taxpayer dollars meant to feed low-income children in Missouri for their own use.”“The defendants are accused of stealing money meant to feed low-income school-aged children and using the funds to live a lavish lifestyle.

              "  'press_release': 'BOSTON – A Florida woman was sentenced today in federal court in Boston for defrauding a Massachusetts housing agency where she worked in 2022, along with defrauding the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) in connection with the pandemic Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).Alihea Jones, 51, of Brandon, Fla., was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Patti B. Saris to 10 months in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release. Jones was also ordered to pay $222,074 in restitution and to forfeit $222,074. In September 2024, Jones pleaded guilty to five counts of wire fraud.In 2022, Jones worked remotely for the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) for six months where she worked with the Residential Aid to Families in Transition (RAFT) program, which provides funds to assist low-income Massachusetts residents facing eviction and other housing emergencies. Immediately after she was terminated, Jones, who was still logged into the RAFT database, accessed the files of four RAFT program participants and authorized electronic payments to their landlords in the amounts of $7,500, $8,800, $6,925 and $10,000. However, Jones changed the routing and bank account numbers from the landlords’ accounts to four unauthorized accounts in Georgia: an account in the name of Jones’s business, Beauty Concepts by Alihea, LLC (Beauty Concepts); Jones’s personal account; and the accounts of persons identified in the charging document as “Friend A” and “Friend B” – all without knowledge or permission from DHCD. After these transfers went through, Friend A and Friend B each paid Jones a $2,000 kickback.Earlier, in 2021, Jones also fraudulently obtained a $187,000 PPP loan from a Massachusetts lender, which the SBA later forgave. Jones spent most of the money on personal expenses, including clothing and restaurants.Under the PPP, authorized lenders issued SBA-guaranteed loans to small businesses during the COVID pandemic to help keep workers employed. If a business spent the money on payroll and other permissible business expenses, the SBA forgave the loan.Jones submitted a PPP loan application to a Massachusetts lender falsely stating that Beauty Concepts had 17 employees and an average monthly payroll expense of $74,800. In fact, Beauty Concepts did not employ anyone. Unaware that Jones’s information was false, the SBA agreed to guarantee a $187,000 loan to Beauty Concepts. The lender transmitted the loan proceeds to the Beauty Concepts account in Georgia. Jones later applied to have her loan forgiven. Again, she included false employee count and payroll information. Unaware that Jones’s representations were false, the SBA forgave the loan principal and accrued interest.In total, Jones caused a loss of $222,074, with $33,225 payable to the DHCD and $188,849 payable to the SBA.United States Attorney Leah B. Foley; Massachusetts Inspector General Jeffrey S. Shapiro; and Ketty Larco-Ward, Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service’s Boston Division made the announcement today. Assistant U.S. Attorney Christine Wichers of the Public Corruption Unit prosecuted the case.'},\n",

              "  'press_release': 'Marc H. Silverman, Acting United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, today announced that on February 28, 2025, VINCENZO MINUTOLO, 38, of Shelton, waived his right to be indicted and pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Kari A. Dooley in Bridgeport to offenses related to his fraudulent receipt of COVID-19 relief funds.According to court documents and statements made in court, on March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided emergency financial assistance to Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\\xa0 One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).\\xa0 In April 2020, Congress authorized more than $300 billion in additional PPP funding.\\xa0 The PPP allowed qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive unsecured loans at an interest rate of 1%.\\xa0 PPP loan proceeds were to be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. The PPP allowed the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spent the proceeds on these expenses within a certain period of time of receipt and used at least a certain percentage of the amount to be forgiven for payroll.The PPP was overseen by the Small Business Administration, which has authority over all PPP loans.\\xa0 Individual PPP loans, however, were issued by private approved lenders, which received and processed PPP applications and supporting documentation, and then made loans using the lenders’ own funds, which were guaranteed by the SBA.Minutolo claimed an ownership interest or representative relationship with City Sounds Productions LLC (“City Sounds”).\\xa0 Between March and September 2021, Minutolo defrauded the PPP loan program of more than $145,000 by providing false information on loan applications for City Sounds, including overstating the yearly gross income for City Sounds; misrepresenting that similar PPP loans had not been or would not be sought when he had, in fact, sought and obtained, and intended to seek and obtain, such loans; and providing fraudulent IRS tax filings and tax payment vouchers for City Sounds that had, in fact, never been filed with the IRS.\\xa0 Similarly, on the forgiveness applications he submitted, Minutolo materially misrepresented having complied with all the requirements of the PPP rules.In addition, the CARES Act created a new temporary federal unemployment insurance program for pandemic unemployment assistance (“Pandemic Unemployment Assistance”).\\xa0 Pandemic Unemployment Assistance provided unemployment insurance (“UI”) benefits for employed individuals who are not eligible for other types of UI due to their employment status.\\xa0 The CARES Act also created a new temporary federal program called Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (“FPUC”) that provided additional weekly benefits to those eligible for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance or regular UI.\\xa0 The Connecticut Department of Labor (CT-DOL) administers UI benefits for residents of Connecticut.Between March 2020 and April 2021, Minutolo defrauded the CT-DOL of at least $86,000, and as much as approximately $273,000, by providing the CT-DOL with fraudulent Pandemic Unemployment Assistance applications seeking unemployment insurance payments in others’ names, including individuals who had died, and individuals who did not know that their name and sometimes other personal information was being used.\\xa0 One fraudulent application was for Minutolo’s grandfather, who died in 2014, and included a telephone number associated with Minutolo.\\xa0 Minutolo continued to make online weekly certifications to the CT-DOL attesting that the information contained in his grandfather’s application, and other applications, were true in order to receive continued unemployment insurance benefits.Minutolo pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud, an offense that carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years on each count.\\xa0 Judge Dooley scheduled sentencing for May 23.\\xa0 Minutolo is released on a $50,000 bond pending sentencing.This matter is being investigated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security – Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Department of Labor – Office of the Inspector General.\\xa0 The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher W. Schmeisser.Individuals with information about allegations of fraud involving COVID-19 are encouraged to report it by calling the Department of Justice’s National Center for Disaster Fraud Hotline at 866-720-5721, or via the NCDF Web Complaint Form at:\\xa0https://www.justice.gov/disaster-fraud/ncdf-disaster-complaint-form.'}]"
